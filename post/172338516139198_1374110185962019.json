If you were hired as a freelancer/contractor to build something \"for\" the client, then the intellectual property: the product, design, code, etc.. is theirs and not yours. Client is paying for your working hours, so anything coming out of those working hours, technically the client owns. \nThat's the convention I know of, so unless otherwise agreed, you generally need THEIR permission to reuse the solution/sell it and not the other way around.\n\nB. If it was \"your\" product or service in the first place and you're just selling / providing them with version of it, customized or not, then it's your property and can negotiate selling it at a price.\nCase B could also apply to a \"part\" of the product you're building for  the client, so let's say some core library/module you have already built in the past (on your own time) that will be included in your end solution. This isn't owned by the client because they didn't pay you to build it, so that's basically the rule of thumb","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154884040385170","length":6,"name":"Meligy","offset":6,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1374768042562900"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0zTkRFeE9UQTVPVEk1TkRRMk1Ub3hORGcxT1RBeU16QTQZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0zTkRjMk9EQTBNalUyTWprd01Eb3hORGcxT1RReE56TTEZD"}}}}
