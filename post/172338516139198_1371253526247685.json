Especially that you are still a student, so it's just the right time to learn what you like, not what your employer wants.\nSecondly, Nobody starts as good enough, everybody starts as a beginner.\nThirdly, understanding security issues better will certainly make you a better developer, even if you don't specialize in security at work.\nFinally, you can always find a job related to security whether locally or abroad one day if you have it in your mind and you are hardworking enough.","can_remove":false,"like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"id":"1371298169576554"},{"created_time":"2017-01-29T15:28:29+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed El Henawy","id":"10154937488445610"},"message":"learn about VMware and virtualization..
