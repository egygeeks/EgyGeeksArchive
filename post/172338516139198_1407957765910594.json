They seem to be doing really well.\nAnd despite my issues with Uber's ethics as a company (especially their corporate culture), they were the trailblazers that created a whole new business model which, love it or hate it, has a huge demand and created several copycats.\nAlso, I'm not sure I agree about the dispicability of greyballing, I remember the aggressive physical attacks against uber drivers in Toronto, Paris, US, and Cairo, and in almost every single case the company immediately took action to protect their drivers and pay for any costs or legal expenses. I think greyballing was more about protecting their drivers, and I do think they had to force their way into some cities to force regulators to update their laws to keep up with the times.\nIn Toronto specifically, where I lived for 11 years, there was an unfair monopoly around taxi licenses, owned by several large families, that made unfair amounts of money renting these licenses out to taxi drivers, these families were close to government officials who helped them maintain their monopolies over these licenses.\nUber broke that monopoly, and Torontonians almost unanimously supported uber during that period because not only was the price of taxis in Toronto obscene, but the service was horrid and it was all controlled by a few corrupt families and politicians.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1408571479182556"},{"created_time":"2017-03-04T11:28:21+0000","from":{"name":"Hisham Fangary","id":"10155564847035839"},"message":"here is an article by an investigative reporter in Toronto detailing how the taxi business screwed both the customer, and more importantly the driver, who was usually an immigrant who got trapped in a bad deal with the license plate owners, and why uber was so welcomed when it arrived in Toronto!\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/sec.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/adventure/red-line/how-uber-is-ending-the-dirty-dealings-behind-torontos-cab-business/article25515301/%3Fservice%3Damp","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1408730615833309"},{"created_time":"2017-03-04T11:31:09+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Oun","id":"10210546759477547"},"message":"No one said they didn't break the monopoly or didn't have a huge impact when starting, but that doesn't mean they aren't evil themselves.
