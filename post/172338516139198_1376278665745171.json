I thought that these models are used in Speech recognition to detect the most likely word but what it will benifit me if my goal is only to check for pronounciation?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1376278665745171"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1376278665745171"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-02-02T13:52:22+0000","updated_time":"2017-02-05T07:27:28+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-02-02T14:34:42+0000","from":{"name":"Amr Medhat","id":"10154469113964779"},"message":"what's the goal of your project? to check pronunciation to the level of letter, word or sentence? depending on your scope you'll decide which models to define and how (phone model, lexicon / dictionary , and language model) - based on your application needs each model will be as simple or as complex as its needs","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1376306429075728"},{"created_time":"2017-02-02T14:56:42+0000","from":{"name":"Hussein Ghaly","id":"10158391110790193"},"message":"I'm only very new in speech, but my understanding is that you'll need to go through all the steps of Automatic Speech recognition (using the language model and the acoustic model) so that you will be able to detect the words and their boundaries, and hence you can check the pronunciation of each word.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1376322135740824"},{"created_time":"2017-02-02T18:30:41+0000","from":{"name":"Tony Raoul Iscaros","id":"10155085965723420"},"message":"if your training data is in form of letters , then you need a language model for forming words for example 3amr it is written عمرو\nalthough there is a missing letter \nI don't know how this model is implemented i just passed by it in a neural network course \nAnd there is something you can do to avoid having a language model , you can have the training data in form of words and not letters.\nYou can also use deep-learning which is harder to develop but will avoid modelling at the first place.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1376504089055962"},{"created_time":"2017-02-04T20:35:59+0000","from":{"name":"Rawan Lazkani","id":"1056510784453053"},"message":"Es RAa تعالي شوفي التعليقات","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"791886160960175","length":6,"name":"Es RAa","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1378699565503081"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0zTmpNd05qUXlPVEEzTlRjeU9Eb3hORGcyTURRMk1EZA3oZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0zT0RZANU9UVTJOVFV3TXpBNE1Ub3hORGcyTWpRd05UVTUZD"}}}}
