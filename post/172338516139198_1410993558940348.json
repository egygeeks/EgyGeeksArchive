The first one is a decoder that produces its output into a directory , if the number of the output files in that directory exceeded X files i wait, the other thread is another decoder that reads the file and use it as input, when its done decoding it eliminates the file. \n\nThis problem is similar to the producer consumer problem, i firstly implemented its code and then modified the condition to work on the problem by sharing the Num_of_folders as the global variable instead of qeue, \n\ni.e: The first decoder is now the producer which writes until X num of files, the second one is consumer which reads the files decode and then remove it. \n\nThe problem that the producer thread always write files even if the condition.wait() is applied that means both threads are not working synchronously. \n\nCan anyone help me with this porblem or can provide another solution instead of consumer/producer algorithm?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1410993558940348"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1410993558940348"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-03-06T13:54:30+0000","updated_time":"2017-03-06T14:19:12+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10206560229244030","name":"Mohamed Hessien"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMDY1NjAyMjkyNDQwMzAZD","after":"MTAyMDY1NjAyMjkyNDQwMzAZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-03-06T13:57:48+0000","from":{"name":"يصفيد بن ذاعات","id":"245030945959317"},"message":"The Fact is you cannot control Thread Synchronicity unless you use some kind of events or mutex please check this post \nhttp://zulko.github.io/blog/2013/09/19/a-basic-example-of-threads-synchronization-in-python/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410995685606802"},{"created_time":"2017-03-06T14:18:15+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Mortda","id":"1480228465362952"},"message":"http://www.bogotobogo.com/python/Multithread/python_multithreading_Synchronization_Semaphore_Objects_Thread_Pool.php","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1411012705605100"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF4TURrNU5UWTROVFl3Tmpnd01qb3hORGc0T0RBNE5qY3cZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF4TVRBeE1qY3dOVFl3TlRFd01Eb3hORGc0T0RBNU9UQXcZD"}}}}
