Why we can't get the small size menu without collapsing ? Things like that which would make the people who came up with responsive design wish if they didn't and suicide.\n\nThat's an example for what i go through, things like standards for example how col-md-4 align in smaller size he wants every single thing in bootstrap to be overwritten to achieve what he wants. Am i wrong or this is a crazy thing. Because what i know that those frameworks are made to give us easy and fast and good maintainable code !!!","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1350412318331806"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1350412318331806"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-01-10T06:59:21+0000","updated_time":"2017-01-11T22:46:13+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-01-10T07:26:23+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"You charge them more","can_remove":false,"like_count":19,"user_likes":false,"id":"1350423791663992"},{"created_time":"2017-01-10T07:30:19+0000","from":{"name":"Amir Abou Eesa","id":"1353018234756623"},"message":"+1000 for Meligy , turn the table through a clear and strong contract.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154884040385170","length":6,"name":"Meligy","offset":10,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1350437071662664"},{"created_time":"2017-01-10T13:03:08+0000","from":{"name":"Hossam Saraya","id":"10158512210325389"},"message":"In such cases, don't use bootstrap!
