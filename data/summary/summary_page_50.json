I bit the bullet and flashed the latest LinageOS 14.1 experimental builds on it... it is not perfect, the camera needs improvement and few audio bugs, but other than that, a very noticeable difference in speed and experience of the very latest \"almost\" vanilla Android.\n\nInterested to hear your opinions and experiences!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-02-12T03:31:41+11:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":2}]}
