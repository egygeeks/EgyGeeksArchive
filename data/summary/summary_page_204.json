Free and OpenSource project licensed under GPLv3.\n\n2. Threaded backup solution as it works on speeding and optimizing the backup process of Rsync by running parallel pool of workers for Rsync.\n\n3. Simple Web console to manage the whole backup process and manage your clients.\n\n4. Users and Authentication system.\n\n5. Template of files/folders names and extensions to exclude during the backup process such tmp and cache files to speed up the backup process and to save disk space and bandwidth.\n\n6. Email notifications system to send a health report of the backup process whether it's successful or there are any failed process.\n\n7. Logs for the backup process which stores the stdout and stderr and display the contents from the web console.\n\n8. List and Restore backup option from Web Console to review or restore. You still have the ability to manage your data from the backup server using SSH.\n\n9. Pre-defined list of common paths to backup for cPanel servers.\n\n10. View current running backup process for each server from the web console.\n\n11. Kill all running backup process for each server from the web console.\n\n12. Test SSH connectivity to the server.\n\n13. Light-weight SQLite database which stores all the backup configuration. So that you can backup your backup configurations and it will be simple for migratation across multiple servers.\n\n[Why?]\nI'm not sure if I'm reinventing the wheel, But i had a long journey with ( I/O, Kernel Crash, HIGH TTR ) issues with both free and enterprise backup solutions. So, I came along with my own code with the help of the great and powerful Rsync utility and there are still too much work to be done on the roadmap. \n\nI'm sharing it here and hope this might be useful for SysAdmins or Python developers who may be interested in such projects.\n\n[Request]\n- Professionals, There is always a better way to do!\nYour feedback and contributions are highly appreciated. It's licensed under GPLv3. So, feel free to fork and spread the world.\n\n- Frontend developers, I need your help in the webpages design. The current design is a slow suicide but this is what it looks like when a sysAdmin holds a painting brush :D\n\n- Users, Despite the fact that I'm using RsyncHero on a production system with +200 machines with different purposes. It's your environment and your choice to use it with no single line of warranty. YOU WILL encounter bugs and YOU WILL have recommendations So, GitHub issues is your friend.\n\nThanks!","caption":"github.com","description":"RsyncHero is a threaded backup solution, It works on speeding and optimizing the backup process of rsync by running parallel pool of workers for the backup process.","created_time":"2016-08-17T07:55:39+10:00","total_likes":13,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1206176636088709","from":{"name":"Ahmed M.
