It allows easy recovery of various kind of passwords by sniffing the network, cracking encrypted passwords using Dictionary, Brute-Force and Cryptanalysis attacks, recording VoIP conversations, decoding scrambled passwords, recovering wireless network keys, revealing password boxes, uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols. The program does not exploit any software vulnerabilities or bugs that could not be fixed with little effort. It covers some security aspects/weakness present in protocol's standards, authentication methods and caching mechanisms; its main purpose is the simplified recovery of passwords and credentials from various sources, however it also ships some \"non standard\" utilities for Microsoft Windows users.","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2012-04-20T07:56:16-07:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_386620258044355","from":{"id":"683805169","name":"Mohamed El Sayed"},"message":"Great Free Course on Building ASP.NET MVC Apps With EF Code First, HTML5 and jQuery (Pluralsight).\n\nhttp://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/04/19/great-free-course-on-building-asp-net-mvc-apps-with-ef-code-first-html5-and-jquery.aspx","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2012-04-20T02:49:09-07:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_386497831389931","from":{"id":"100000116116716","name":"Mohamed Sameeh Sharaf"},"message":"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته\nياشباب انا عاوز اعمل upgrade لنسخة الويندوز بتاعى win 7 Enterprise \nعشان تكون sp3 \nبس مش عارف :( لما دورت على النت لقيت لينكات ل xp !!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2012-04-19T20:30:49-07:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":6},{"id":"172338516139198_386823888023992","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2012-04-20T10:21:11-07:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_387610801278634","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din"},"message":"what do you guys use nowadays to download music?
