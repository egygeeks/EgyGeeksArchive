I need some recommendations for books about architecture in general. Most of the books that I found are old and I guess will be outdated. Web servers, Caching, In-memory stores, Key value stores,  Proxies, Load balancers, Message queues, Sharding and Replication of stores. I'm really interested in this kind of posts : https://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast & http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html . The idea of thinking of and architecturing highly scalable systems and the design patterns used. Maybe what I'm asking for is too much for a single book but at least you got my point. I'd be really thankful if you could recommend some books or even the proper search keywords. Thank you.\nEDIT: The closest to what I'm searching for was \"Service-Oriented design with Ruby and Rails\" ( http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321659368 ) it contains chapters about Load balancing, caching and messaging.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-16T12:05:01+11:00","total_likes":5,"total_comments":5}]}
