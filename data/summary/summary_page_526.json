They are usually useful for optimization problems. One such algorithm that is rather simple and intuitive is Particle Swarm Optimization.\n\nThis algorithm models the behavior of a bird flock, where each bird in the swarm/flock is a potential solution to the problem and the birds fly through the search space to find the global optimum.\n\nMost algorithms that do that try to strike a balance between \"exploration\" and \"exploitation\". Where initially the search space is widely explored, with possible optima influencing the search direction slightly. As the search goes on, the algorithm gradually shifts to an exploitation stage, where the search is \"focused\" around a potential optimum (here, the search would exploit the position of the optimal bird in the flock). The balance between both stages usually depends on how you tweak the algorithm's parameters, and is very important: A highly exploratory implementation may never converge to a solution, while a highly exploitative one could converge very quickly but get stuck in a local optimum. \n\nAnother example is the \"Ant colony\" algorithm which has been used to solve the traveling salesman problem, and in routing protocols, since ants are clever at finding shortest/optimal paths in that case.\n\n","caption":"en.wikipedia.org","description":"In computer science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.
