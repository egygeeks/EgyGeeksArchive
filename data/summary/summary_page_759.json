Recommended.\nHe also has a free youtube channel called SimpleProgrammer that has a lot of videos on career and soft skill topics.\n\nThere is one important point to make clear though. These numbers do NOT`mean you should have %15 technical skills and 85% soft skills.\n\nThis totally depends on your role. Each role is different. this ratio might work for entrepreneur, they definitely won't work for a senior developer.\n\nThe numbers don't represent the investment you need to put, but the effect.\n\nIf I want to move from developer to senior developer, learning to know how to deliver feedback to other developers, how to communicate technical problems to business people, can make WAY more valuable senior developer.\n\nAnd \"likely\" a higher paid one (because you deliver more value, and you know how to present it).\n\nOf course there are exceptions, but I don't think it's smart to optimize your life for trying to be the one who succeeded while failing at leadership skills, or communication with other people.\n\nIf you want to be exceptional, be the one that combines both. Those are quite rare in fact :)","caption":null,"description":"Incredible....and I agree","created_time":"2015-11-20T18:49:28+11:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_1034516553254719","from":{"name":"Mohamed Shokr","id":"1414205518631560"},"message":"أنا صحيح مبتدئ في البايثون لكن ملاحظ أننا معندناش كومينتي قوي للبايثون في مصر في حين أن في كتير بايثون ديفيلوبيرز محترفين مصريين و شغالين في مصر ... كومينيتي يكون ليه أسهام حقيقي في ال Open Source Community.. حاجة كده زي PyUk وأمثاله كتيرررررر لدرجة أن كل مدينة بقي ليها ال Python Community الخاص بيها اللي تقريبا كل واحد منهم ليه مؤتمره السنوي .... كل اللي كنت بفكر فيه أننا ليه ميبقاش عندنا PyEgypt ..  ولما دورات كل اللي لقيته ال Repo دي واللي تفاعل عليها كان تقريبا من شخصين بس و أنعدم خالص دلوقتي  حتي ال <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-eg\n> google Group بقالها أكتر من سنة مهجورة ... يا تري أيه المشاكل اللي تخلينا منقدرش نعمل PyEgypt ؟؟ \n\nhttps://github.com/Pyeg <1>","caption":"github.com","description":"GitHub is where people build software.

It's not straightforward. I'll have to explain it and maybe users won't get it.\n2.
