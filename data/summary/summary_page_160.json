Keep in mind that iOS uses EDGE (lower bandwidth, higher latency), 3G (higher bandwidth, higher latency), and Wi-Fi (higher bandwidth, lower latency) to connect to the Internet. Therefore, you need to minimize the size of your webpage. Including unused or unnecessary images, CSS, and JavaScript in your webpages adversely affects your site’s performance on iOS.\n\nBecause of the memory available on iOS, there are limits on the number of resources it can process:\n\nThe maximum size for decoded GIF, PNG, and TIFF images is 3 megapixels for devices with less than 256 MB RAM and 5 megapixels for devices with greater or equal than 256 MB RAM.\nThat is, ensure that width * height ≤ 3 * 1024 * 1024 for devices with less than 256 MB RAM. Note that the decoded size is far larger than the encoded size of an image.\n\nThe maximum decoded image size for JPEG is 32 megapixels using subsampling.\nJPEG images can be up to 32 megapixels due to subsampling, which allows JPEG images to decode to a size that has one sixteenth the number of pixels. JPEG images larger than 2 megapixels are subsampled—that is, decoded to a reduced size. JPEG subsampling allows the user to view images from the latest digital cameras.\n\nThe maximum size for a canvas element is 3 megapixels for devices with less than 256 MB RAM and 5 megapixels for devices with greater or equal than 256 MB RAM.\nThe height and width of a canvas object is 150 x 300 pixels if not specified.\n\nJavaScript execution time is limited to 10 seconds for each top-level entry point.\nIf your script executes for more than 10 seconds, Safari on iOS stops executing the script at a random place in your code, so unintended consequences may result.\n\nThis limit is imposed because JavaScript execution may cause the main thread to block, so when scripts are running, the user is not able to interact with the webpage.\n\nRead “Debugging” for how to debug JavaScript on iOS.\n\nThe maximum number of documents that can be open at once is eight on iPhone and nine on iPad.\niOS Note: In iOS 1.1.4 and earlier, the JavaScript execution time was limited to 5 seconds and the size of allocations to 10 MB. Also, the limit on the size of canvas elements was the same as Safari on the desktop.\nIn iOS 2.2.1 and earlier, the sum of all of the frames needs to be less than 2 megapixels—that is, width * height * number of frames ≤ 2 * 1024 * 1024. In iOS 3.0 and later, the limit only applies to one frame at a time.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2012-12-13T21:35:54+03:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_496339290405784","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2012-12-14T00:58:49+03:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_496652397041140","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2012-12-14T19:00:11+03:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_496751140364599","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":"Chrome Extension that turns any copied rich text into markdown when pasting to textarea.
