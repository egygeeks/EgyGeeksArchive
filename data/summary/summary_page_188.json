I am going to be the person who changes that so I'm trying to come up with the whole process. I have researched few things but not sure which way to go:\n- Continue using Microsoft SQL Management Studio for all the DB work and just connect it with TFS and check in the change scripts.\nOR\n- Abandon the Management studio and use Microsoft Visual studio (we have 2013) for the DB design, edit, and so on. And this way I can use TFS to keep the DB under control. \nI'm open to all suggestions, but be mindful we are really trying to keep it inside the Microsoft house.\nThank you all.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-10T07:12:20+10:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":6},{"id":"172338516139198_1228185513887821","from":{"name":"Ahmad Nazmy","id":"10154268924640143"},"message":null,"caption":"grahamcluley.com","description":"The CallJam malware masquerades as a four-star rated Android game on Google Play, and has a worrying addiction to making premium rate phone calls.","created_time":"2016-09-10T22:35:52+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1228092387230467","from":{"name":"Mohamed Abdelrahman","id":"1448981871792319"},"message":"سلام عليكم ياريت اللى عنده مشكلة فى مصر  فى البنك بتاعه مع paypal يبعت feedback بتفاصيل المشكلة ل paypal عشان هما بيجمعوا feedbacks بخصوص المشاكل مع البنوك المصرية عشان يتواصلوا مع البنك المركزى وان شاء الله نأمل خير انهم يوصلوا لحل دى محاولة مش هتأخد منك أكتر من 5 دقايق الكلام ده بناء على customer service agent كلمنى وقالى على الخطوة دى","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-10T19:34:32+10:00","total_likes":10,"total_comments":6},{"id":"172338516139198_1228540483852324","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shawky El-faky","id":"10210082325758741"},"message":"هل فيه طريقه اقدر  فى الـ live  ف الفيسبوك أنى استخدم كاميرا خارجيه غير كاميرا الموبايل؟ \nمثلا :- GoPro camera","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-11T07:32:54+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1228957323810640","from":{"name":"Taha Amin","id":"10154850341220590"},"message":"http://www.pcworld.com/article/3117793/security/a-usb-device-is-all-it-takes-to-steal-credentials-from-locked-pcs.html","caption":"pcworld.com","description":"A security researcher demonstrated that all it takes to steal an OS account's password hash from a Windows computer in a locked state, is to plug in a special USB device for a few seconds.","created_time":"2016-09-11T18:39:25+10:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1228305187209187","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abo Mazin","id":"1337260053029891"},"message":"Are there any solution for that i searched google before i asked","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-11T01:35:30+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_1228544287185277","from":{"name":"Ahmad Magdy","id":"715713385273130"},"message":"ممكن حد يفيدني \nممكن الاقي كتاب Head First Design Patterns فين في مصر","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-11T07:38:06+10:00","total_likes":5,"total_comments":14},{"id":"172338516139198_1229398030433236","from":{"name":"Mohamed Elsherif","id":"10158483817400314"},"message":null,"caption":null,"description":"تسجيل اللقاء، شكرًا لكل الحضور و للمناقشة الرائعة و نتمنى ان تجمعنا مناقشات و اجتماعات اخرى في المستقبل ان شاء الله.\n","created_time":"2016-09-12T05:22:02+10:00","total_likes":24,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1228219260551113","from":{"name":"Mohammed Al Ashaal","id":"740831752757314"},"message":"my latest open source project in golang, is for docker .\nit's a standalone automated http reverse proxy for docker containers, i called it \"droxy\" ( [D]ocker p[roxy] )  .\nhttps://github.com/alash3al/droxy\n--\nwe know that there is another one but it uses \"nginx\" + \"docker-gen\"","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-10T23:19:25+10:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1229142577125448","from":{"name":"Ibrahim Mohammed","id":"1726284604348944"},"message":"Is there a good software to restore and data from a formatted hard disk, which actually restore anything back and have been used by anyone ?!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-11T23:29:09+10:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":3}]}
