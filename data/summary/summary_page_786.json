Now for a serious cross platform IDE, only Jetbrains is in a position to do that now :)\n\nSo why now? Because we believe it is the right time due to several factors:\n\nWe’ve been working for several years in allowing ReSharper to work in different environments, independently of Visual Studio. An example of this is dotPeek.\nIt’s quite clear that there’s an ever increasing tendency of developers using non-Windows platforms, and we’d like to give them the same experience they’ve come to know and love with ReSharper.\nFinally, Microsoft moving its platform and C# language towards Open Source, along with initiatives such as CoreCLR, have been an added incentive.\n\n","caption":"blog.jetbrains.com","description":"Today, at NDC London, we announced a new project that we’ve been working on for a little while – a cross-platform C# IDE, based on the IntelliJ Platform and using ReSharper technology.","created_time":"2016-01-13T23:56:20+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1061768387196202","from":{"name":"Kareem Zakaria","id":"10210360519722665"},"message":"If anyone is a member in any other useful groups like this, please add their links in a comment.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-01-14T00:47:04+11:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1061009290605445","from":{"name":"Ahmad Alfy","id":"10154097389365670"},"message":"Just now a voice came in my dream and said:\n\"The event that you're wondering why is it being triggered twice is because the height of the element changed too ...

I'm sure most of you have heard of IEEE. Well, the branch at my university in Aswan is hosting this really big event that we're calling Upper Egypt in Action. It's sort of like EED, but for students in Upper Egypt who are working on graduation projects, or any projects they think could solve problems or be useful for people in the long run, and would like to get financial support and recognition for their work.\n\nIf you're a student in any Engineering school in Upper Egypt and would like to participate, you can visit http://www.upperegyptinaction.com/ to register, and you can even register as a visitor if you'd like to attend the sessions and see this year's projects. The visitors registration page is not up yet though.\n\nI'm not sure I can cover the whole thing in a post, but I'll leave the event link here, and if you have any questions you can ask me or post them there.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/864131057018710/","caption":"upperegyptinaction.com","description":"\" UPPER EGYPT IN ACTION \" is a 2-days conference that includes technological & soft skills sessions and exhibition for graduation projects made by Upper Egypt's talented young people .
