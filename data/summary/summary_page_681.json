(I know its odd but it happened!)\nTwo years ago, A colleague  was interviewing some developers for a senior position, and one had satisfied and met all the requirements.\nHe didn't hide his shallow hands on experience weakness, but rather than that, he was perfect in all other aspects. He even challenged us if we can come up with a technical issue he cannot solve, we've thoroughly tested him in the following:\n* Oveloading, Overriding, Constructors and Destructors.\n* Static VS Object properties and methods.\n* Magic Methods __get() and __set()\n* SQL injections\n* Security best practice for accessing and retrieving data from DB.\n* DB Shriding Techniques.\n* Clustering ..\n* Cloud Computing\n* SOAP VS REST\n* Case studies.\n* Decision making.\n* Implementation Scheduling.\n* Client handling.\n\n.... These are what I can recall now....\n\nWe've end up with a developer that only needs more life scenarios to be fully qualified for the position...\nActually I was hesitating to give him the position, but the decision wasn't mine.\nHowever, he got it ... and he showed some serious developing skills ...\nHis secret was just simple: He Never Stop Learning and Fetching New Area of Knowledge...\nSo.. What do you think?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-06-06T12:33:20+10:00","total_likes":9,"total_comments":6},{"id":"172338516139198_955562621150113","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"For the People who would like to Adapt new technologies and tools.\n\n","caption":"thoughtworks.fileburst.com","description":null,"created_time":"2015-06-08T09:42:55+10:00","total_likes":3,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_955676367805405","from":{"name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad","id":"10158142026600408"},"message":"Fellow geeks,\nSome of you post wonderful links to interesting content, which I for one am almost always thankful for. It would be great if you included a couple of sentences about the content that you were linking to though. Many of us browse on phones, and so it is actually rather inconvenient to have to open up a browser only to discover that the content is not relevant to you - it's not just sheer laziness. Hope you consider that in your future posts.\n\nThanks.\n\n/rant","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-06-08T14:51:41+10:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_955779071128468","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mabrook","id":"10210329906978730"},"message":"#WWDC15 ..","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-06-08T22:17:49+10:00","total_likes":9,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_955895051116870","from":{"name":"Ahmed Elshaer","id":"1320087908034535"},"message":"How Awesome :D","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-06-09T04:19:35+10:00","total_likes":24,"total_comments":11},{"id":"172338516139198_956092501097125","from":{"name":"Osama Soliman","id":"709206249239999"},"message":"You needn't worry about ur sensitive/important data again from bad/obtrusive  guys 3:) ... easily give 'em ur device/account after entering the fake password/pattern ... \n\nur account/device will have 2 passwords\n1st >> leads to real device with ur data\n2nd >> leads to fake device with fake date\n\n#Python small project Demo ... \nPlease who can co-operate with me developing this idea with native java for android ^_^ ? it's an easy one ... just a lock screen ... and hide files program .. mix together to get our project done","caption":"github.com","description":"SecondWayPassword - This is small project .. a 2nd way password to protect u from bad guys by entering a fake password which will lead to fake date","created_time":"2015-06-09T14:25:27+10:00","total_likes":10,"total_comments":13},{"id":"172338516139198_956398717733170","from":{"name":"Ahmed Sadek Mohamed Tawfik","id":"10154215525191922"},"message":"كيف حالكم :) .. اقتراح آخر (ليس جديدا بالتأكيد .. و ليس الأول من نوعه بالطبع) \nمتى نمتلك شهادة (Certified Egyptian Geek)  ؟!! :D","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-06-10T06:43:31+10:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":7},{"id":"172338516139198_956750504364658","from":{"name":"Ahmed Imam","id":"1869368279977636"},"message":"Hi everyone,\nWanted to share some puzzle platform examples from my game Space Platform, a first person platformer coming to iOS 24 June 2015.
