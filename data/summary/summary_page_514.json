adds a new entity to that repo and Exists checks if a certain entity exists on the repo, \nmy question is, if I want to test Exists and Create, can I use each method to test the other, but in this case I would have used an untested method to test another, If I'm to rewrite the logic used to add the entity, I would have broken the DRY principle, it seems like a loop, how should this be done?\nnote: mocking the repo is out of
