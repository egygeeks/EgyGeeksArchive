The paper that sparked all research in brain-machine interfaces:\n\n\"Real-time control of a robot arm using simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex \" \n\nChapin et al.,\n\nTL;DR: This is the first published effort to record neuronal activity and use it to electronically drive actuators in a robot-arm. The implications at the time were that this could lead to prostheses that are directly controlled by the brain, and \"feel natural\". There's still *a lot* to be done in that area, but things like feedback and bi-directional interfaces have already been demonstrated. Meaning, there are now research prosthetic arms with which humans can \"feel\" things like touch and finger/palm formation. Things which we take for-granted, but are actually critical.\n\nhttps://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490i/07wi/papers/paper011.pdf\n\nEDIT: In case you're *really* interested, this review article, though somewhat dated (2006), does a decent job at giving an overview of BMIs:\n\nhttps://cs.rochester.edu/~kautz/Courses/290Bspring2008/NeuroRobots/TiNS_2006.pdf","caption":"courses.cs.washington.edu","description":null,"created_time":"2015-03-29T06:00:24+11:00","total_likes":7,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_916098091763233","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"الكومنتات فيها روابط لتفاصيل أكتر","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-03-28T18:34:35+11:00","total_likes":12,"total_comments":11},{"id":"172338516139198_916433521729690","from":{"name":"Mohamed Elsherif","id":"10158483817400314"},"message":"The weekly hangout for Egyptian Geeks Developers.\n\nThe Event time\n08:00 PM Cairo Local Time\n11:00 AM US (Pacific Time)\n02:00 PM US (Eastern Time)\n\nاللقاء الأسبوعي للمطورين المصريين و مجموعة Ask Developer على Google+ Hangout \nاللقاء يوم السبت الموافق 4 أبريل 2015\nالساعة 8 مساءً بتوقيت القاهرة\nالساعة 11 صباحاً بتوقيت الولايات المتحدة (توقيت الساحل الغربي)\nالساعة 2 ظهراً بتوقيت الولايات المتحدة (توقيت الساحل الشرقي)﻿","caption":"Ask Developer Hangout - 44 - Getting started with PowerShell with Sherif Talaat","description":"The weekly hangout for Egyptian Geeks Developers.\n\nThe Event time\n08:00 PM Cairo Local Time\n11:00 AM US (Pacific Time)\n02:00 PM US (Eastern Time)\n\n\nاللقاء الأسبوعي للمطورين المصريين و مجموعة Ask Developer على Google+ Hangout \nاللقاء يوم السبت الموافق 4 أبريل 2015\nالساعة 8 مساءً بتوقيت القاهرة\nالساعة 11 صباحاً بتوقيت الولايات المتحدة (توقيت الساحل الغربي)\nالساعة 2 ظهراً بتوقيت الولايات المتحدة (توقيت الساحل الشرقي)﻿","created_time":"2015-03-29T11:34:04+11:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_916541755052200","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"Curious about how the I/O 2015 Experiment was built?
