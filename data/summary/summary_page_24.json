How Egyptian software companies charge clients ? Do we consider Dollar price into out calculations ? Is there any other way of determining the cost of software ?\n\nAnother question, \nFor a fresh graduate software engineer in Egypt how can I decide if I'm being offered a fair salary when I cant find such available statistics?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-02-25T14:27:43+11:00","total_likes":12,"total_comments":3}]}
