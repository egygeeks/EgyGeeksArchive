The documentary shows how MIT staff wrote their programs and how they built compact small machines that wasn't possible at this time.\n\nThere is a lot of interviews with software developers who worked on the mission and a lot of interesting information for us as programmers. During the landing process they had an error with the code 1202. It was the code for the overflow error. Normally it should've crashed but thanks to an engineer who built a revolutionary operating system at this time that allowed the computer to dump less important tasks and operations in favor for the important stuff.\n\nThis is a documentary that is worth every minute of your time to watch. Enjoy it.","caption":"dailymotion.com","description":"The third episode details the story of MIT's work on the Apollo Guidance Computer.","created_time":"2016-04-25T06:06:35+10:00","total_likes":9,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1131604063545967","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":null,"caption":"eng.uber.com","description":"To show how a microservice is implemented in Uber Engineering's ecosystem, we look at the development of Tincup, our currency and exchange rate service.","created_time":"2016-04-26T04:30:54+10:00","total_likes":3,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1131608690212171","from":{"name":"Mostafa Saady","id":"10206685319731894"},"message":"الخاصية دي ممكن تكون مفيدة لبعض الناس","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-26T04:39:27+10:00","total_likes":3,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1129552763751097","from":{"name":"Esraa Mansour","id":"10209395890388244"},"message":"I need JavaScript library to convert html to PDFs and suitable for Arabic content ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-22T23:25:51+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_1131927810180259","from":{"name":"Abdelrady Fcis","id":"10211811206896077"},"message":"250k by negotiation !","caption":"uk.businessinsider.com","description":"Haseeb Qureshi, a former professional poker player, shares how he was able to double his starting salary in just a few weeks, and get a job at Airbnb.","created_time":"2016-04-26T16:11:30+10:00","total_likes":9,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1131713510201689","from":{"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","id":"10210243495897310"},"message":"Checkout my latest screencasts about \"Introduction to gulp and browserify\"\n\nقابلت اكتر من developer مكنش عارف gulp و browserify و طلبو مني اشرحلها ف عملت كام فيديو صغيرين بيشرحو الموضوع\n\n","caption":"youtube.com","description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-26T08:27:24+10:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":7}]}
