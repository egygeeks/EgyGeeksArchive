Yet, one of the most accurate definitions of “Innovation” is: an original idea that has value. As the value of an idea can only be measured by the acceptance of the community and by its impact, we find it mandatory that Innovations should belong to the market, where it can be tested and its true value and impact can be measured. For that purpose, “Take your Innovation to the Market” event was created.\n\nTake your Innovation to the Market, is an event organized by GESR with the aim of bringing together the innovators form all disciplines, and from both business and academia, to come together and to use the power and the value of innovation as a way to solve Egypt social challenges.\n\nDetails & Registration: http://gesr.net/en/take-your-innovation-market","created_time":"2014-04-28T07:18:46+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_738064119566632","from":{"name":"Salah Jr Ahmed","id":"10154647662667880"},"message":"Guys, We need for a small size start up 2 javascript developers with a high experience in JQuery - Bootstrap 3.0 please let me know I will send you contact needed in a private message.
