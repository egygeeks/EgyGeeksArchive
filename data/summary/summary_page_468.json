This is the same size as Windows 8/8.1 install base. In other words, nothing.\nTo put it another way, all the Apple laptops you see at trendy coffee shops and those in Movies and TV shows are all the Apple laptops there is, it's not the tip of any iceberg :D\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/apple-google-microsoft-where-does-the-money-come-from-7000026043/","caption":"www.zdnet.com","description":"If you want to know why big tech companies act the way they do, follow the money. Based on the latest SEC filings, Apple's still a successful hardware company, and Google's still in the advertising business.

I think Twitter already supports HTTP2 (but I'm not sure).\n- So far, HTTP2 will allow for non-SSL connection. There's a push to make SSL/TLS required for all connection (which I'm in a favor of, I have to say).\n- Main goal seems to be to reduce number of trips between server and client.\nHe put together a PDF with all the details. Check it out. It's not all technical details but also history of HTTP and how we got here.\nhttp://daniel.haxx.se/http2/","caption":"daniel.haxx.se","description":"This document describes http2 at a technical and protocol level.
