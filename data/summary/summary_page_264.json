I manage a few hosting accounts for friends and recently I moved from managed VPS to digitalocean ... Everything is running perfectly except for emails ...\nI did a lot of research ... The options I found was either:\n1- Use a third party service like https://www.mailcheap.co/ ... Seems to fit exactly what I need but it's expensive ($24/mo)\n2- Run my own mail server using Mail-In-A-Box on digitalocean. It will cost nearly $120/yr but I read a lot of articles and discussions on reddit and hosting forums discouraging running your own server. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server.\n3- Use a free service like Zoho mail but it is limited to one domain per account and 10 email addresses per account. I can create multiple accounts but I don't want to do that.\n\nI would like to get your input if you have any experience.","caption":"digitalocean.com","description":"When setting up a web site or application under your own domain, it is likely that you will also want a mail server to handle the domain's incoming and outgoing email.

The cool thing about it is that problems are not just algorithmic. I remember some included looking at the waveform of a given audio file, a problem with no statement, debugging some HTTP headers of the problem's page, writing a program to play a JS game, etc.. You can have a look on the problems archive and you'll understand what I mean. Also you can join the contest as a team. Here's the invitation email :\n\n\"Your favorite programming competition is back for its 18th year! We excitedly invite you to compete in IPSC 2016.\n\nInternet Problem Solving Contest is an online programming competition for teams of up to three people. The problems range from easy to very hard, so everyone is welcome to compete. We also have separate ranklists for individuals and secondary school students. You can use any programming language, or even solve problems by hand. Most of the problems are algorithmic in nature, but IPSC is particularly known for its unusual and fun problems.\n\nIPSC 2016 will take place on Saturday, 18 June 2016 from 11:00 to 16:00 UTC. Visit http://ipsc.ksp.sk/ to register, either as an individual or as a team of up to three people.\n\nWhile you're waiting for 18 June 2016, you can also visit http://ipsc.ksp.sk/train/ to practice on problems from previous years of IPSC.\n\nIf you like IPSC, help us spread the word! Tell your friends, classmates, coworkers, internet strangers, et cetera.\n\nGood luck in the contest, and have fun!\n\nIPSC Organizing Team\n\"","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-06-07T20:52:47+10:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":1}]}
