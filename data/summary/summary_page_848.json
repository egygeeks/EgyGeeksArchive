Your public key is shared to the world and your private key must be kept in the safest place. \n\nA lot of technologies depend on Public Key Encryption. For example, the https certificates. In your browser you will find several certificates for major companies. Actually these certificates are the public keys. In fact the public key of google and facebook exists in all the browsers in the world, while the private key is the most top secret in these companies. They even have special hardware equipment to store it.\n\nIt takes sometime to understand how it works but it is essential for any programmer to understand this concept. I suggest watching the following list of videos from khan academy, it clearly describes this way of encryption in simple and interesting way\n\n","caption":"khanacademy.org","description":"Why do we need public key cryptography?","created_time":"2016-04-07T18:07:20+10:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1119177588121948","from":{"name":"Ahmed Talaat","id":"10154670794632639"},"message":"I think Google has a comedy show director from Hollywood or something 😂","caption":"youtube.com","description":"Pivotal with Reto Meier is Asynchronous Pair Programming at Scale.
