English mathematician Ada Lovelace is widely considered the world's first computer programmer for her invention of the computer algorithm. Born in 1815 to the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Byron, Lovelace's mathematical talents led to an ongoing collaboration with mathematician Charles Babbage, who called Lovelace the \"Enchantress of Numbers.\" While translating an article by an Italian engineer on Babbage's Analytical Engine, a proposed early version of a mechanical general-purpose computer, Ada added her own set of notes which contained a tremendous breakthrough -- the first computer program or algorithm.\n\nAda Lovelace Day was started in Britain in 2009 as a day for creating new role models for girls and women in technical fields by raising the profile of today’s female STEM leaders. The event's founder, Suw Charman-Anderson, described the significance of this special day as follows: \"Ada Lovelace Day is not only about raising Ada’s profile, but also shining a spotlight on the achievements of all women in STEM, both historic and modern. It’s about drawing inspiration from all women, not just the famous ones, and supporting women at every stage of their career, from the choice of what to study at school and university through too often challenging professional milestones.\" \n\nIn honor of Ada Lovelace Day, please tell us about a historical or modern day woman in STEM who inspires you -- and, if it's someone you know personally, you can also tag her in the comments below. To learn more about Ada Lovelace Day, visit their website at http://findingada.com/\n\nIf you'd like to introduce your children to Ada Lovelace's incredible story, there's a brand new picture book biography, \"Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine,\" for ages 5 to 9 at http://www.amightygirl.com/ada-lovelace-thinking-machine\n\nThis trailblazer is one of the 52 female scientists profiled in the recently released “Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science – and The World,\" which is highly recommended for teens and adults alike at http://www.amightygirl.com/headstrong-52-women \n\n11-year-old Ada Lovelace is also the star of the fictionalized mystery novel for ages 8 to 12, “The Case of the Missing Moonstone,” at http://www.amightygirl.com/the-case-of-the-missing-moonstone\n\nFor adult readers who would like to learn more about Ada Lovelace and her contributions to computing, check out \"Ada's Algorithm: How Lord Byron's Daughter Ada Lovelace Launched the Digital Age\" at http://amzn.to/1R9d6Up\n\nIf you'd like to inspire your Mighty Girl's interest in science, you can introduce her to many stories of girls and women in science -- both in fiction and real-life -- with the titles featured in our \"Science & Technology\" book section at http://www.amightygirl.com/books/general-interest/science-technology \n\nAnd, for more fun ways to encourage your Mighty Girl's interest in technology and computer programming, check out our blog post, \"Inspiring Invention: 25 Engineering, Technology, & Math Toys for Mighty Girls\" at http://www.amightygirl.com/blog?p=7896\n\nThanks to the WomenRockScience Tumblr page for sharing this image!","created_time":"2015-10-14T11:13:55+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1019246764781698","from":{"name":"Sabr Bry","id":"10202565635620285"},"message":"كبسولات :)\n\nwritten by Mostafa Ashour","caption":"mostafaashour.com","description":"يخضع الكثير من العاملين في مجال صناعة السوفت وير في هذه البقعة من العالم لما يسمى بالـ Dunning–Kruger effect","created_time":"2015-10-14T08:20:18+11:00","total_likes":13,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1019414994764875","from":{"name":"Ahmed Yousry Ebrahim","id":"10154919785242481"},"message":null,"caption":"intellisc.com","description":"User Presence with Rails using PrivatePub and Redis 0 Rails is a really nice framework for developing websites, however if you want real-time communication Rails will not be the best option.
