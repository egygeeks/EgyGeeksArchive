Debian is significant because it is one of the most widely-spread distributions and the base of many other distributions, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.\n\nAfter lots of mediation efforts failed, Debian is finally going to be forked. The freedom-supporting fork will be called Devuan.\n\nAlthough this is not about technical aspects, it is about policy, and about the philosophy of free software and the role of civil society in protecting ideals.","caption":"lists.dyne.org","description":null,"created_time":"2014-11-29T22:24:01+11:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_853220544717655","from":{"name":"Marwa Dosoky","id":"10155139969921248"},"message":"Hi Geeks, i want to ask u about something but i don't know if it is violates the posting roles; if it is , feel free to remove it ;)\n\nI was asked to develop an app for a clinic, obviously this is supposed to be a small project.
