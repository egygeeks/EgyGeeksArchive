The latest system's data throughput was > 3.2 GB/s. So, we were no longer able to acquire to SSDs without the software crashing* because their throughput is an order of magnitude less. \n\nI ended up turning off file caching and buffering** in the win32 file IO API, taking up ~35 gigs of RAM and setting them up as RAMdisk. I would stream to RAM this way, and then copy to disk after the fact. This setup limits the imaging session to ~ 10 seconds. The next step I'm taking is splitting the data writes over 2 PCIe SSDs. \n\nIs there anything I could do differently to handle this kind of throughput more efficiently? Do you perhaps know of some lossless compression algorithm that is fast enough? Something else?\n\n* Crashing is because of the buffer overflows in the acquisition card and because the software sucks.\n** If you ever want to do this, make sure that all the buffers you want to write to a file are page aligned. VirtualAlloc() lets you allocate page-aligned memory.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-30T14:17:46+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1247718588601180","from":{"name":"Mostafa Fotoh","id":"243131289481868"},"message":null,"caption":"backchannel.com","description":"Neural net startup Bonsai launches AI for dummies.","created_time":"2016-10-03T07:34:16+11:00","total_likes":5,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1247575648615474","from":{"name":"Mostafa Fotoh","id":"243131289481868"},"message":"15-Sorting-Algorithms-in-6-Minutes :D","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-10-03T04:32:49+11:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1247381398634899","from":{"name":"Hesham Watany","id":"10211830164526211"},"message":"Is there any company in Egypt specialized in machine learning ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-10-03T00:11:05+11:00","total_likes":3,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1248030331903339","from":{"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","id":"10210243495897310"},"message":"Amazing article for anyone who still getting confused about frontend build tools","caption":"medium.freecodecamp.com","description":"Front end build tools can be confusing even to experienced developers like me.
