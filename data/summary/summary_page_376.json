As a result, we had multiple reports from our users saying that \"I stopped playing Angry Birds and started looking for workarounds in your application instead. I just couldn't get enough of it!\".\n\n“We introduced the roles of bug owner, bug user experience designer and bug architect in the team. Developers started test driving the bugs because it makes much more sense than test driving bug-free code. Finally, we are measuring the business value of each bug in terms of customer feedback and prioritize the bugs based on the experience we think they create.”","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-03T06:49:37-08:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_709536332419411","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-03T08:21:55-08:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_709550555751322","from":{"id":"1755401963","name":"Abdullah El-menawy"},"message":"#DevMix","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-03T09:00:55-08:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_709485645757813","from":{"id":"100001793708731","name":"Mohamed Badawi"},"message":"How much math do I need to know to start learning statics ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-03T06:12:31-08:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":12},{"id":"172338516139198_709282832444761","from":{"id":"652024918","name":"Amr Eldib"},"message":"How to apply Salted Password Hashing in PHP, Java, ASP.NET (C#) and Ruby on Rails.\nGiven the rise of password-stealing attacks.
