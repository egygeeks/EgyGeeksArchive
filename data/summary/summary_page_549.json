HTTP/2 uses the same HTTP APIs that developers are familiar with, but offers a number of new features they can adopt.<p>One notable change is that HTTP requests will be ‘cheaper’ to make. The Web community has often told developers to avoid adding too many HTTP requests to their pages, which lead to optimization techniques like code inlining or concatenation to reduce the requests. With HTTP/2, a new multiplexing feature allows lots of requests to be delivered at the same time, so the page load isn’t blocked.<p>HTTP/2 also uses significantly fewer connections, hopefully resulting in lower load for servers and networks. Nottingham previously published a number of other improvements coming to the standard on his blog.<p>The new HTTP standard was based on Google’s SPDY protocol, which is used today by some technologies to manipulate traffic which helps improve latency and security, delivering faster page load times. Google announced just a few days ago that it plans to switch fully to HTTP/2 in Chrome.<p>Developers wishing to test HTTP/2 before it becomes official can already do so now in Firefox and Chrome, along with downloadable test servers to try improvements for themselves. More information is available in the HTTP/2 FAQ.<p>It should be a relatively short time before the standard is passed through the Request-For-Comments Editor and published for use in its final form.<p>➤ HTTP/2 is Done [mnot’s blog]","created_time":"2015-02-18T18:06:00+11:00","total_likes":13,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_897124183660624","from":{"name":"Ahmed Koraïem","id":"10158351896530402"},"message":"Dataset containing 1000+ indices about Egypt, from the World Bank. excel format w/ metadata.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-19T10:52:34+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_897124580327251","from":{"name":"Ahmed Koraïem","id":"10158351896530402"},"message":"Dataset containing 1000+ indices about Egypt, from the World Bank. csvformat w/out metadata.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-19T10:53:20+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_897137330325976","from":{"name":"Muhammad Sherbeeny","id":"10158237074750527"},"message":"Worth trying!","caption":"virl.io","description":"WIN an all-expenses paid trip to Amsterdam!","created_time":"2015-02-19T11:35:17+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_897344713638571","from":{"name":"Bahy Maghrabia","id":"1424611524279210"},"message":"Mozilla Egypt Tour - Mansoura \n#MozillaEgyptTour1","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-20T00:49:56+11:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0}]}
