The course will focus on the Haskell programming language but just as an illustration language, the concepts and ideas demonstrated in this course are the same in most languages and the lessons you will learn during this course will affect the way your brain work and eventually will make you a better and more conscious programmer.\n\nWe will cover the basics of Haskell programming language and eventually you will be able to understand the meaning of those words properly: Types, Type Variables, Monads, Type Classes, Value Types, Kinds, Applicatives, Functors, Pure Functions, Recursion, Tail Recursion Optimisation, Pattern Matching, Set/List Comprehensions, Currying, Algebraic Types.\n\nIf you are a life-long imperative programmer (Java, C, and etc.) you will enjoy this brain wrestling and I will challenge you to change the way your brain works.\n\nThe course is totally free, and will be delivered online.\n\nAbout the instructor :\n================\nAhmed Soliman is an entrepreneur, software and systems architect coming from a diverse background of highly scalable applications design, mission-critical systems, asynchronous data analytics, social networks design, reactive distributed systems, and systems administration and engineering.
