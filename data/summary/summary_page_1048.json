Do you experience such delays with other ISPs?\n2. Do you think this is the local ISP problem, or it's a regional/global ISP issue?\n\nThanks in advance.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-11-19T06:08:41+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_1299103843462654","from":{"name":"BoTinya WaHeed","id":"10154618620947909"},"message":"Geeks,\nI wanna ask a silly Question that am trying to find an answer for.\nI have a SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB got to be \"Data Write Protected\" on it's own & having an auto drive of CD-Rom, although the files are not a read only.\nI tried each & every resolution over the internet.\nAm gonna buy another one but still i wanna this one to work ..\nAny Help ??!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-11-20T21:58:44+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1299271803445858","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abdel-Razzak","id":"10158374972650523"},"message":"v0.3 released supporting 13 Banks (with at least 6 currency exchange rates each)\n","caption":"github.com","description":"EGP-Rates - EGP exchange rate scraper from EG Banks","created_time":"2016-11-21T02:29:40+11:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1299259966780375","from":{"name":"Aboubakr Gamal","id":"10212365276868126"},"message":"كان في حد هنا عامل موقع بيجيب اسعار العملات من مواقع البنوك .\nكنت عايز اعمل حاجة شبيهة في موقع عليه بيانات و عايز اجيب البيانات من الصفحات .\nكنت عايز اعرف ايه الحاجات اللي اتعلمها عشان اعمل الحاجة دي ؟","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-11-21T02:10:32+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_1299234750116230","from":{"name":"Mohamed K.
