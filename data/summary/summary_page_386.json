them exceeded the allocated size.\n\nthe problem arise if you're responsible of a system and wanted to monitor small websites\nsizes without blocking their expansion, so you'll have to create a deamon application that\nalert you when one of them exceeds the size expected.\n\nthis script will do so, it'll iterate on a set of directories and check their size\nand alert you if one of them exceeded their size, and will wait for one hour then try again\n\nyou can change the waiting period and directories set and sizes expected in bytes.\n\ngist:

JSON with \nthe entity data.\n\nGithub API rate limit is 60 request per hour per IP address, so\nyou'll hit teh limit pretty fast if you don't have an authorized \napplication, Oauth applications gets upto 5,000 requests per Hours\nPer IP address, this script uses a non authorized approach.\n\nfirst you'll get the users first page of gists, to get second page\nyou need to add \"?page=2\" to the end of URL, but as we said we can't\ndo this because of the rate limit, if you'll use the second approach \nthen you're welcome to add this parameter and increase it each time.\n\nsecond we'll iterate over all gists and make directory for each using\nits unique ID and save the gist files to that directory.\n\naaaand its done, you have your latest 30 gists in a your local machine\nin no time.
