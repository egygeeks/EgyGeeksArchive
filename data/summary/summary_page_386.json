No where on their website do they link to a pricing page.\n\nBut get this, it's actually mentioned in their terms of service...  http://jukebux.com/terms.php?lang=uk clause 4\n\nIt's a rare occasion for an average joe computer user to read the terms of service and those who do, rarely understand it.\n\nSo they get your credit card on system, charge you £1.

Jukebux, a dark patterns embracer. There's a much more deeper plot behind what actually happened, how they scammed her into getting an account (She didn't knowingly know she was signing up for a Jukebux account) I'm still investigating how this happened.\n\nLesson:\n**Read The Terms Of Service**","caption":"darkpatterns.org","description":"Dark Patterns: fighting user deception worldwideA Dark Pattern is a type of user interface that appears to have been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.Normally when you think of “bad design”, you think o...","created_time":"2014-03-20T22:43:25+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_717627444943633","from":{"name":"Ahmed Elwerdany","id":"615998291927934"},"message":"أنا نزلت بايثون وكله تمام ,, وأشتغلت إمبارح بالNotepad و cmd عشان أشوف النتائج \nتمام !! \nلما كنت بحفظ الملف اللي انا كتبت فيه الكود كان بياخد شكل النوت باد وعليه بايثون وبيشتغل معايا تمام\nدلوقتي مش بياخد شكل بايثون خالص علي نوت باد ,, ومش بيشتغل علي cmd خالص .. \nإيه الحل !!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-20T22:52:07+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":1}]}
