Categories are saved on a different table. Both clauses and categories are editable by the user.\nWhat I want to do is to create a page where these clauses will be grouped by category. \nEach clause should have a check box next to it allowing users to choose what applies.\nI'm not sure what ASP controls to use. I thought about nested repeaters but the idea isn't appealing. \nI also think a combination of a repeater and a gridview will also complicate things. \nIt will be ideal not to show empty categories. \nI'm pretty sure you geeks will impress me :)","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-12-09T09:30:40+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1320242141348824","from":{"name":"Amr Yousef","id":"10212914666760274"},"message":"--Update : Issue resolved Now...turns out Gson wasn't the issue.\n\nAny suggestions from Java geeks in here?..
