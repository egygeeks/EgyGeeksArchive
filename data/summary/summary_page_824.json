After looking around for away I found that services like Hola VPN does this, and it's for free, BUT it's not programmable (Doesn't have an API or something I can talk to programmatically :( ).\n\nMy question: is there away through which I can programmatically change the machine's (it's a Windows Server BTW) proxy setup depending on service or a tool like Hola ? Or really any other way.  \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPS: The one solution I could come up with was to use the Hola Chrome extension and use NodeJS to control the mouse and trigger the change, but we all know that this is stupid and unreliable (but I tried it and it's working :) ). If you are wondering about the mouse being controlled by code and not by the user, know that this software will be running on a remote Windows/Linux server, and wont be accessed that much.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-09T06:11:01+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1092893030750404","from":{"name":"Ibrahem Salah","id":"1103643933095809"},"message":"Hello guys,\ni want to know how to add texture tiling controller predefined script in unity in a dynamically created models.\nThe problem that my texture is being displayed so ugly\ncan anyone tell me how to solve this issue \nthe last image is the solved case using texture tiling controller\nAny ideas or another solutions?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-07T20:31:00+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_1094418537264520","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/how-we-build-code-at-netflix.html?utm_content=buffera9830&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer&m=1","caption":"techblog.netflix.com","description":"http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/how-we-build-code-at-netflix.html?utm_content=buffera9830&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer&m=1","created_time":"2016-03-10T09:27:12+11:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1094416230598084","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abdul Fatah","id":"10211954222794711"},"message":"Did anyone travel for masters in Europe Canada or Australia ?
