Diab & originally suggested by the journalist Ismail Al Eskandarani. The idea is to convert the book of the same name[2] to an interactive map with rich info & images. It allows end-users to enter the data.\n\nBecause of the nature of the app & that Egyptians rarely do crowd-sourcing, my budget for hosting the initial version is zero. Also I will put ads in there, so if the site gets a lot of traffic, it can cover its own hosting  money.\n\nLet's dive in technicality: In the beginning I thought that I would make it a static website hosted on gh-pages & use GitHub for editing geojson, but GitHub uses maps for viewing only, not editing. Also, GitHub is not Egyptian-end-users-friendly.\n\nNow I have to make a dynamic part, so there are the options in my head now\n\n1. Use gh-pages for the front-end & a small back-end to edit geojson & upload images to github. I'm still thinking of the best way to do authentication.\n\n2. Make a dynamic app on AppEngine. I get a free instance, but I will be locked.\n\n3. Make a dynamic app on Heroku (or a similar thing?). I want a free instance with DB storage.\n\n4. What is the best option to store images? Flickr gives 1TB free, but I'm open to suggestions\n\n[1]: https://github.com/mtayseer/cairo_streets_stories\n[2]: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289626","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-27T22:44:19+11:00","total_likes":11,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_720816357958075","from":{"name":"Ahmed Magdy","id":"10154728972235376"},"message":"JavaScript Equality Table\nhttp://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/","caption":null,"description":"JavaScript Equality Table\n\nhttp://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/\n\n#JavsSCript #JS","created_time":"2014-03-27T20:16:56+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_721180947921616","from":{"name":"Mohamed Elsherif","id":"10158483817400314"},"message":"MVEL is a very good and cool project if you are using a JVM based language and you want to provide either full scripting language support or just minor predicates parser\\interpreter support.\nI am using it now, and it is pretty solid.","caption":"mvel.codehaus.org","description":"MVEL is a powerful expression language for Java-based applications.
