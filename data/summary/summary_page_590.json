It is not a dating website the name is just unique  :)\n\nWe are trying to create a platform aimed to residents of Egypt, to help in adding value to their lives and not just waste their time. There are a couple of new feature which we are sure would interest you, like \n\n-Marketplace: Where you can see and buy anything.\n\n-Forums: Where you can share a subject with the website members.\n\n-Your very own Business Profile: Where you can post daily updates about your job.\n\n-Private notes: Where you can write notes for yourself in a customized way.\n\nI would like to personally invite you to this platform, Facebook page link: https://www.facebook.com/zabtny.comEgypt \n\nWe look forward to hearing from you :)\n\n*We am really sorry if you felt uncomfortable with such approach, but we are doing our best to be selective with our users and it would be our honor to have you all as members on our website.","caption":null,"description":"An Egyptian Community Empowering People","created_time":"2014-12-24T01:21:51+11:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":4}]}
