Upon inspection, it turns out it was a dark pattern.\n\nThe service offered a 14 days trial for £1. No where on their website do they mention a monthly subscription fee and for how much. No where on their website do they link to a pricing page.\n\nBut get this, it's actually mentioned in their terms of service...  http://jukebux.com/terms.php?lang=uk clause 4\n\nIt's a rare occasion for an average joe computer user to read the terms of service and those who do, rarely understand it.\n\nSo they get your credit card on system, charge you £1. You agreed to the terms of service likely without reading it, TOS mention a EUR/GBP 50 charge upon the trial ending and next thing, you're wondering what happened to your money.\n\nAnyway, that's that. Jukebux, a dark patterns embracer. There's a much more deeper plot behind what actually happened, how they scammed her into getting an account (She didn't knowingly know she was signing up for a Jukebux account) I'm still investigating how this happened.\n\nLesson:\n**Read The Terms Of Service**","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","created_time":"2014-03-20T11:43:25+0000","total_likes":0,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_717627444943633","from":{"id":"100005533063912","name":"Ahmed Elwerdany"},"message":"أنا نزلت بايثون وكله تمام ,, وأشتغلت إمبارح بالNotepad و cmd عشان أشوف النتائج \nتمام !! \nلما كنت بحفظ الملف اللي انا كتبت فيه الكود كان بياخد شكل النوت باد وعليه بايثون وبيشتغل معايا تمام\nدلوقتي مش بياخد شكل بايثون خالص علي نوت باد ,, ومش بيشتغل علي cmd خالص .. \nإيه الحل !!","created_time":"2014-03-20T11:52:07+0000","total_likes":0,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_717636601609384","from":{"id":"627907956","name":"Emad Elsaid"},"message":"Facebook group hall of fame script\n\nif you're a facebook group admin, and you faced a tiny problem\nof \"who are the active members in my group?\" and want to make\nanalytics about it, here is the magical way.\n\nthis script will find the target group by its name and get the\nlatest posts pages till it reach a certain limit or exceed it\nthen will merge the posts in the form of (user -> count of posts)\nthen sort them descending and show you the group Hall of fame\n\ni usedkoala gem (it is very simple and i used it before alot), \npsych gem to to_yaml, if you prefer you can save it as json or\nany other format, have fun playing with it.\n\nPS: BTW, this song is a little inspiring when you're running the script :D\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk48xRzuNvA\n\nGist: https://gist.github.com/9662408","created_time":"2014-03-20T12:25:40+0000","total_likes":4,"total_comments":10},{"id":"172338516139198_717689821604062","from":{"id":"100003351667804","name":"Mohamed Nasser Amein"},"message":"لو سمجتوا انا محتاج كورس جرافيك سى ++ من البداية خالص عربى او انجلش","created_time":"2014-03-20T15:12:38+0000","total_likes":0,"total_comments":2}]}
