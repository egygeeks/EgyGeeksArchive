This site is work with Wordpress engine, so use php, xml, and a few html too.\n\nThe questions is how we can reach the following result?\n\n1.\n\nWe have an agent contact form under every property page. Like u can see here: http://immobiliare.affariungheria.com/property/bauhaus-con-stile-a-budapest/ .\n\nBut I want that this form would be available only for registred users. When these users fill the form and click on the Send button we have to send the form to 3 different mailboxes. Now we can send to only one.\n\n \n\n2. For this i attached a pic about backoffice of the site. We call it the riverse pairing. The consists of this the following:\n\nThe basis of the improovement is the Newsletter. The client make a registration to the site with a \"Send me newsletter\" option. Then he can fill and save an extended search form what type of properties he need.\n\nWhen new property advertisement arrive into the database what is suit to the client’s needs in the backoffice appear 2 button in the row of the property (Porpose/Cancel) or only a checkbox. With these buttons the regional chief can decide that make a porpose to the client in the newsletter or not. In this way the chief can attache property offers into the newletter. When the chief selected every property what he want to send, click on an Attache button. At this moment in a pop up window appear the newsletter with the name of the client and some text why he get this letter, the links for properties maybe the feature image tumbnail and the client's search rules. For sure the client can unsubscribe from it. On the top of this popup we need a send button which would send the newsletter to 3 mailbox.","caption":"immobiliare.affariungheria.com","description":"Bancadati immobiliare Ungheria","created_time":"2016-07-17T03:26:07+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1183262365046803","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mahfouz","id":"10212072846353700"},"message":"http://www.unixawy.com/docker-persistent-storage-mysql-server-selinux/","caption":"unixawy.com","description":"hello everyone today we will make MySQL Docker Container with Shared Storage first lets pull latest mysql  version of docker [crayon-578a8906b8994077178573/] after we done download the latest image this image come handy with some awesome parameters MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD MYSQL_DATABASE with this  param...","created_time":"2016-07-17T05:10:00+10:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1183340181705688","from":{"name":"Adnan Saad","id":"1432765203454787"},"message":null,"caption":"goo.gl","description":"في البداية، عندما أطلقت قوقل نظام تشغيل كروم للعالم كمنصة لتشغيل التطبيقات مع الاتصال بالإنترنت، لم","created_time":"2016-07-17T07:50:31+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1183254485047591","from":{"name":"Mahmoud A-Azim","id":"1785078528478743"},"message":"Looking for Backend (PHP) course any recommendations?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-07-17T04:47:23+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1183400671699639","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":null,"caption":"crontab.guru","description":"An easy to use editor for crontab schedules.","created_time":"2016-07-17T10:12:48+10:00","total_likes":3,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1183385798367793","from":{"name":"Osama Soliman","id":"709206249239999"},"message":"A more than good website \n","caption":"livecoding.tv","description":"LiveCoding is an interactive social coding platform where you can watch professionals code in real time.
