It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, filed on January 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.\n\nThe algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-07-11T19:55:30+03:00","total_likes":7,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_780749701964740","from":{"id":"1614120164","name":"Eslam Hamouda"},"message":"Atom is now available on Windows.","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-07-10T12:11:20+03:00","total_likes":9,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_781652438541133","from":{"id":"601801267","name":"Hosam Kamel"},"message":"Hi guys, looking for an interactive timeline web control, anyone has a hands-on experience with any?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-07-11T23:24:36+03:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_781670261872684","from":{"id":"540788204","name":"Ahmed Hassan"},"message":"not bad :)","caption":"www.itexplorida.com","description":"Everyone wants to know that what exactly Windows 9 and when it will be released?
