I am looking for a recruitment advise. I have been looking for a good technical team that has experience in the open source stack and knowledge in a heterogeneous, high availability project but I still can't find them. I have budget, I want four team members in a different levels. I can't find a complete team that integrates well together and will get me the expected results. \nDid anyone face the same problem before? Shall I switch technology and start depends on the .NET stack? Shall I hire people from East Europe? I didn't start yet but I can see the risk. \nYour thoughts are highly appreciated","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-13T12:58:49+10:00","total_likes":15,"total_comments":25},{"id":"172338516139198_1124002820972758","from":{"name":"Ahmed Saleh","id":"10158326787715574"},"message":"Does anybody know about QT state machine ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-14T18:33:00+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1123640794342294","from":{"name":"Morad Edwar","id":"10212482712403270"},"message":"حد طلب منى ادور على Designer  هيصمم كتيب 70 صفحة مقاس صغير واقرب لبرشور .. الشغل عبارة عن تصميم الغلاف + الصفحات الداخلية اللي عبارة عن نص ومعاه صور او خرائط .. اللي يعرف حد ياريت يمنشنه او يكلمنى على الاينبوكس وانا هوصله بالمنظمة اللى محتاجة التصميم :)","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-14T05:29:15+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":6},{"id":"172338516139198_1124193247620382","from":{"name":"Hany Essam","id":"1342489319142943"},"message":"What's the best tool for 1:1 online teaching?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-15T02:00:56+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1124290087610698","from":{"name":"Amr Ragaey","id":"10155099815523748"},"message":null,"caption":"developers.redhat.com","description":"So you finally surrendered to containers and discovered that they solve a lot of problems and have a lot of advantages: First: Containers are immutable – The OS, library versions, configurati…","created_time":"2016-04-15T05:18:31+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1118004994905874","from":{"name":"Ahmed Amin","id":"1813081165632012"},"message":"السلام عليكم\n\nمن فضلكم يا شباب إيه فضل Host لمواقع ASP.Net بس يكون بيدعم تقنيات حديثة\n\n.Net 4.5 or 4.6\nSQL 2012 or 2014\n\nوالاهم Mail Services تكون فيه شغالة كويسة لأنى بعانى بصراحة من سوء خدمة Arvixe ومش عارف هل Godaddy تفى بالغرض والا لا ؟","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-06T00:59:10+10:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_1124107187628988","from":{"name":"Ahmed Aswani","id":"10158476825265637"},"message":null,"caption":"youtube.com","description":"The Mythbusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman demonstrate the power of GPU computing.","created_time":"2016-04-14T22:18:47+10:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1124270677612639","from":{"name":"Mohammed El Sayed","id":"10154884040390170"},"message":"Attention geeks :)","caption":"thenextweb.com","description":"Microsoft’s Visual Code Studio, announced at last year’s Build conference, has reached its 1.0 release.","created_time":"2016-04-15T04:33:39+10:00","total_likes":16,"total_comments":6}]}
