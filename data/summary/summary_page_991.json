I opened Pintrest and I wasn't logged in. The browser prompt me to login with my account \"Sign in with your account saved with Google Chrome\". It isn't pintrest ... This isn't some DOM element with an overlay .. It's the browser. Like the native alert box! I don't know what is that. I decided to check incognito; the message showed up exactly with my email.\nIs that a new API? does anybody know what is this? This is purely a browser thing I have never seen before.\nI am using the dev-channel specifically 55.0.2859.0 (Official Build) dev-m (64-bit)\nI tried searching and found nothing. I will dig deeper into pinterest code but I don't have time for that.\nClicking on Sign in or the email just close the box ... nothing happens. This is why I think it is something new and experimental.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-21T08:53:50+10:00","total_likes":11,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_1238063749566664","from":{"name":"Mostafa Muhammad","id":"10154873940166210"},"message":"Not sure for how long has this feature been around but Google will plot functions in 3D for you when you google them\n\ntry this out\n\nsin(x) + cos(y)","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-22T05:39:09+10:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1237486012957771","from":{"name":"Mohamed Azazy","id":"1793705700654899"},"message":"Google Allo is available to download in the next few hours and they're introducing Google Assistant as a chat bot!","caption":"allo.google.com","description":"Introducing Google Allo, a smart messaging app that helps you say more and do more.
