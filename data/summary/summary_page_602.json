I've got a little problem there...\n\nOriginally I'm a PHP developer, but I work with a framework I've made myself. I edited some front-class-interface file I've found out somewhere and I combined it with Symfony2's Universal Class Loader. It was a difficult job but it ended up as something perfectly customized for my needs, I used that to implement few projects and it was perfect.\n\nBut when I think about this project, I need to use something that has more solid rules, like a solid framework or so. I tried CodeIgniter but honestly I don't believe it would be the perfect choice for something like that, especially after the discontinued support and then lending it to another organization and so.\n\nI never worked with NodeJS nor Meteor (and I mentioned Meteor because even though it's not popular, I've heard incredibly positive feedback about it) so I don't know whether those would be a better choice or not.\n\nSo, what do you guys think? Which framework should I use for something like that? Or should I use my native thing?\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe back-end should be a simple API that receives some data and returns a URL. There's a lot of processing done in the background though, specifically MHTML to HTML conversion and a lot of regex stuff. There should also be protection against spam so there will be a database that logs user entries where old entries get purged every while and then.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-01T12:16:46+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_888396101200099","from":{"name":"Muhammad Sherbeeny","id":"10158237074750527"},"message":"مجموعة شركات شغالين في مجالات مختلفة:\nتعليم، زراعة، صحة، مياة، طاقة\nومايعرفوش عن UX ومدى اهميته لأي منتج او خدمة المستخدم بيتعامل معاها... مقتنعين ان ال UX ده حاجة لبتوع ال IT وبس!\n\nحد فيكم يعرف فيديو كويس يشجع الناس دي انها تفهم وتهتم بال UX وانه مهم لجميع الصناعات مش ال IT بس؟\n\nاو حتى مقال ؟\n\nوياسلام لو الفيديو او المقال بالعربي... حلم طبعا :D\nبس لو بطلنا نحلم نموت :D","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-01-31T07:13:23+11:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":7},{"id":"172338516139198_893202574052785","from":{"name":"Mohammed Khalaf","id":"1692622017433057"},"message":"Hey everyone ....\ncan anybody recommend to me a book which explain advanced regular expressions especially on php ?\nThanks in advance :)","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-10T12:38:54+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_893248034048239","from":{"name":"Ahmed Samir","id":"10210675814484396"},"message":"I need free hosting please anyone advice me?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-10T15:32:52+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_892968354076207","from":{"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","id":"10210243495897310"},"message":"very intelligent tool for managing multiple nodejs versions\n\nhttps://github.com/creationix/nvm","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-10T01:17:37+11:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_893564940683215","from":{"name":"Alaa Ali","id":"10154999548701303"},"message":"#watchpeoplecode subreddit.. \nwatch coders instead of lamis el 7adidi :)","caption":"www.reddit.com","description":"This subreddit is dedicated to everything related to live coding video, streams and broadcasts.","created_time":"2015-02-11T09:40:26+11:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_893663597340016","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"https://medium.com/@aaronjbarker/responsive-navigation-for-73-languages-83eec588db28?mc_cid=3158d3aeb6&mc_eid=8a071967df","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-02-11T15:21:21+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_893666504006392","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"Good Study for E-Commerce Startup Owners and Product Developers.","caption":"smashingmagazine.com","description":"Kyle Peatt uses real data to give an understanding of the argument against e-Commerce carousels and whether they deserve the reputation they’ve gained.","created_time":"2015-02-11T15:32:13+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_893346904038352","from":{"name":"Hisham Abd El-Hafez Eid","id":"10155080508766171"},"message":"awesome and creepy at the same time","caption":"mashable.com","description":"Google's latest four-legged robot named Spot can walk, climb, run and take a hit.","created_time":"2015-02-10T22:26:26+11:00","total_likes":7,"total_comments":1}]}
