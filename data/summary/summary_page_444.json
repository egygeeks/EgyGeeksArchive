I am having a *slight* problem that I couldn't find a solution for. Before heading to Stackoverflow or github I thought anyone could help :) Wish I am right :)\n\nThe problem is, I am using jade files to generate a static HTML ... There is a task called usemin that concatenate JS and CSS files ... This task fails to work properly ... The concatenated files are generated on the dist directory but the reference in the HTML fails to update\n\nThe HTML look like this:\n    <!-- build:js scripts/plugins.js -->\n    <script src=\"scripts/file.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"scripts/another-file.js\"></script>\n    <!-- endbuild -->\n\nThe task should create the plugins.js file and update the reference in the HTML file ... It creates the file but fails to update the HTML file.\n\nAm I making any sense? If anyone could help I could post my Grunt.js file ... And for sure It will be a debt, I will help you with your next whatever project :D Offering a free PSD to HTML/Origami or a help with your bext Backbone/Angular/React/Whatever app :D","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-05-10T23:27:49+03:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_744325828940461","from":{"id":"740765313","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"},"message":"ِAsk Developer Podcast الحلقة 34, في هذه الحلقة نناقش موضوع ال Freelancing و كيف تبدأ فيه و ما هو و مميزاته و عيوبه و بعض النصائح من التجارب الشخصية.","caption":null,"description":"ِAsk Developer Podcast الحلقة 34, في هذه الحلقة نناقش موضوع ال Freelancing و كيف تبدأ فيه و ما هو و مميزاته و عيوبه و بعض النصائح من التجارب الشخصي...","created_time":"2014-05-11T00:05:49+03:00","total_likes":8,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_743631762343201","from":{"id":"100002377283171","name":"Ahmed Abo Mazin"},"message":"Hello Geeks \n1-do you see any different writing a file and writing a log file do you see any different ?if yes Give the answer\n2-do you see  that php is has less quality as jave 2ee?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-05-09T19:31:18+03:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_744331032273274","from":{"id":"794574128","name":"Ahmed Adel"},"message":"In Shock .. from the new Firefox Update .. very similar now to chrome.
