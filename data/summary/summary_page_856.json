The audio playing through the monitor is high pitched and faster than usual. I know it is a software problem because i have dual boot on my laptop and on Windows the same cable/same monitor works just fine. I read that it is a problem in Ubuntu (I am on 14.04) because of difference in sampling rates, I tried some stuff but didn't work out. Anyone had this problem before?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-18T03:54:19+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1126268940746146","from":{"name":"Mohamed Abdel Aty","id":"10212491964880718"},"message":"as a quick and dirty hack, does unmounting a drive (or removing its drive letter) will protect its content from current ransomeware ?\n\ni know it is not that hard for a program to search for a physical drive and access its content but is this a known behavior for current ransomwares ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-18T07:01:29+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1126255864080787","from":{"name":"Anas Rabei","id":"621823724675667"},"message":null,"caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-18T06:28:41+10:00","total_likes":7,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1125043390868701","from":{"name":"سامح دعبس","id":"1873036762957490"},"message":"الموضوع ده أثير هنا قريبا, و كنت أتكلمت عنه قبل كده, فأحببت مشاركتكم بما أرى...\nLearn technologies just in need not just in time!\nhttp://samehdeabes.blogspot.com/2016/01/learn-technologies-just-\nin-need-not.html","caption":"samehdeabes.blogspot.com","description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-16T09:32:05+10:00","total_likes":17,"total_comments":4}]}
