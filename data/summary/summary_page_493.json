Tip: use the post date to go to post details, then from post details, use post date again to go to original Facebook post.\n\nSubmit bugs and ideas in the GitHub repo\nhttps://github.com/egyptian-geeks/EgyptianGeeksArchive/issues\n\nCheck out all the code on our new GitHub home\nhttps://github.com/egyptian-geeks\n\nTo do:\n- Better design.\n- DONE Fix date display (seems like all dates are today's).\n- DONE Add user pictures.\n- Add search box.\n- whatever you want....\n... more issues are already added to issues\nhttps://github.com/egyptian-geeks/EgyptianGeeksArchive/issues","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-07-21T03:09:11+03:00","total_likes":14,"total_comments":10},{"id":"172338516139198_788528637853513","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-07-24T01:46:03+03:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_788559901183720","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":"Google New Fonts for all Languages.
