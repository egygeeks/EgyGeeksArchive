That said, we don’t have a single female on our tech team 😯 - but we’re working on fixing that!\n\nElves is excited to offer a FULL scholarship for a female candidate that gets accepted to AlMakinah, an intense 12 week bootcamp that produces entry level, full stack developers. AlMakinah graduates are basically guaranteed great jobs in one of the most sought after fields and can boast being taught and mentored by Egypt’s greatest tech minds.\n\nWe’d already signed up to hire at least one person per batch (that’s how much we believe in them) but we felt it was important to try and support this awesome initiative even further.\n\nNo excuses now! If you’ve been thinking about learning how to code and getting into tech this is your chance - IT IS NOT TOO LATE! If you are an awesome, dedicated, smart, female candidate and want to build cool things like Elves we will proudly support you! 💪\n\nLearn more here! https://www.almakinah.com","created_time":"2017-02-23T02:13:44+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0}]}
