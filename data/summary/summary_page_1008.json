Ihab Khattab","caption":null,"description":"We're pleased to announce the open source release of Yarn, a new JavaScript package manager built in collaboration with Exponent, Google, and Tilde. With Yarn, engineers have access to the npm registry, but can install packages faster, more securely, and more reliably. Yarn enables engineers to move faster and with confidence when using shared code so they can focus on what matters — building new products and features.","created_time":"2016-10-12T02:57:08+11:00","total_likes":18,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1250125231693849","from":{"name":"Mostafa Mohamed","id":"10212320139347568"},"message":"hello geeks,\ni have a question ...\ni made a framework of applications ... its something private that i have been working on.\nso in order to put it in action i needed 2 pc's running windows server.\n\nit consists of several nodes\n\nmain_node <-> security node <-> auth_node <-> Node_Manager <-> gateway\n\nNode_Manager:\n->client_node <-> launches the nodes 1~x the the same server for client_node.\n->Node 1\n->Node 2\n->Node 3\netc ....\n\nthe problem is that my client_node could be launched several times.\nwhen i made it i designed it that way for security reason and load balancing\n\nso when ever i launch the client_node the Node_Manager asks for both (internal ip,wan ip)\nand starts to manage the session encryption between every node (its dynamic for every node depends on the time/ip subnets)\n\nso i can not launch the client_node more that one time on the same system because of the ip subnet and nodes mutex.\n\ni ran it on a vps.\nwhat i need is to make the windows act like if it has another Ethernet adapter with another ip to force the node to create\ndifferent mutex.\n\nso here is what i have tried\n- a vm system hosting windows server and i tried all types of ethernet config available\n- external vpn which worked fine except the node asks for a local ip to connect back to.\n- a loopback adapter\n- a proxy hosted on another system except it asks for a local ip\n- creating a system hook service and push back every packet to the buffer as a temp fix but it didn't work because of my in-app virtualization\n- creating custom firewall routes using powershell\n\ni suffered from that problem for weeks,\nso any suggestions?\n\nthanks!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-10-06T01:59:07+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_1255778494461856","from":{"name":"Ahmed Aswani","id":"10158476825265637"},"message":"impressive","caption":"wired.com","description":"The president in conversation with MIT's Joi Ito and WIRED editor-in-chief Scott Dadich.","created_time":"2016-10-13T01:06:19+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1255835174456188","from":{"name":"Tarik Ibrahim","id":"10155335676276062"},"message":null,"caption":null,"description":".NET Rocks Interview: Angular 2, ASP(.)NET Core and Docker","created_time":"2016-10-13T02:48:55+11:00","total_likes":7,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1255848704454835","from":{"name":"Moaaz Goda","id":"1929189813967524"},"message":null,"caption":null,"description":"The Open Guide to Amazon Web Services","created_time":"2016-10-13T03:14:52+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1255559764483729","from":{"name":"Ahmed Kamal","id":"10206651440364620"},"message":"Very well explained.","caption":"youtube.com","description":"RSA Public Key Encryption Algorithm (cryptography).
