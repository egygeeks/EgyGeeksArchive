We need to do research, we could need computing and storage and bandwidth.\n\nSS: This guy in IT says there are 2 guys who implemented this on the internet.\nTA: What 2 guys?\n\nSS: 2 guys in MIT for their masters thesis.\nTA: So 2 guys in MIT spent maybe 2 years working on something like this, and you want me to understand and implement and compete with other coompanies in a month?\n\nSS: It's not that complicated, I am sure there is code on the internet that does it.\nTA:And I suppose the MIT guys only handled English, so in 1 month I am supposed to do Arabic as well?\n\nSS: That is our deadline.\n\nTA researches for a day.\n\nTA: I did some research, obviously this is extremely complicated and even the most basic algorithm to do this would have like 10% accuracy.\n\nSS: No we need to say that it is 70%.\nTA: Excuse me, how on earth are we gonna do that?\n\nSS: We can do a POC and keep improving, nothing is impossible.\n\nTA: Impossible and unfeasable in timeframe are pretty close.\nSS: No, we must burn the midnight oil and do whatever it takes.\n\nTA: But what your asking makes no sense whatsoever. Couldn't we just integrate with an engine that does that? and sell the customer a solution that actually works instead of doing something we know will be very low quality and will never meet his expectations.\n\nSS: No the solutions are expensive, it will be cheaper to develop ourselves.\nTA: But in 1 month we will have a very low quality solution with very low accuracy if we have anything at all.\n\nSS: No, if we focus and work hard we can have something.\n\nTA: But only  5 companies do this all over the world with any reasonable accuracy and 2 guys at MIT did a Masters thesis in 2 years. If working hard for 1 month could have achieved that, wouldn't that make the multinational companies and guys at MIT stupid?\n\nSS: We have a customer request and a deadline.\n\nTA: If the customer asked for a ladder to climb to the moon, would that make it possible?\n\nSS: We have a dream and we need to pursue it.\n\nTA: You have a dream to make a sale, I want to actually have a realistic goal, otherwise this sounds like a disaster.\n\nSS: You need to be innovative and brave. \n\nTA: And smart? And realistic? \n\nSS: bla bla bla","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-12-21T09:02:47+11:00","total_likes":8,"total_comments":10},{"id":"172338516139198_864423616930681","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"The design review from hell:\n\nThe TA does a design review on a small application that does surveys and saves them to the database.\n\nTA: I was looking at your database design, You have a list of questions for each survey. The wierd thing is that you have each question as a column in your table and each survey as a separate table.\n\nTL: That is correct.\n\nTA: But that means to add another question to a survey, you need to add another column to the table and to add another Survey you need to add another table.\n\nTL: That is correct.\n\nTA: But shouldn't we be doing basic database normalization and actually be able to add a question as a row? Shouldn't surveys have their own table with each survey having it's own row? Wouldn't that make adding an extra question or survey very easy and simple.\n\nTL: The customer only asked for 5 surveys.\n\nTA: And what happens when he wants to add a question to a survey or a new survey?\n\nTL: He will create a change request and we will do it for him.\n\nTA: Yeah, but if you had tables and rows like I said you would just have to add some rows in each table.\n\nTL: The time it wil take me to add a row, is the time it will take me to add a new table with columnns as questions.\n\nTA: But you can just build a page so the customer can create his own surveys and add questions to them.\n\nTL: That is not in our scope or in the requirements, we will be the ones adding the questions.\n\nTA: Are you kidding me? Why am I wasting my time like this? I'm not here to explain basic database design. Why do you even ask for a design review?\n\nTL: Because the process says so. If you want to complain, talk to the PM.\n\nTA: PM, this is basics of computer science here, what are we arguing about?\n\nPM: I don't have time for design, and I don't have time to do the right thing","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-12-21T09:36:37+11:00","total_likes":8,"total_comments":6},{"id":"172338516139198_864863263553383","from":{"name":"Ahmed Ezz","id":"10154919378101955"},"message":"Cloud Computing Presentation,\nBy my friend Ahmed Said he is a senior SharePoint consultant if any one wants to ask him anything","caption":"youtube.com","description":"Do you know what is cloud computing?
