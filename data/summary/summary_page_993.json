Neural Networks were invented in early 1950’s as a mathematical model of brain neurons. They have been used in many applications as image recognition, natural language processing, face detection, image captioning, and even recently learning algorithms. Many academic institutions, large corporations, and startups work in deep learning and hiring researchers, software engineers, and data scientist. In this session, you will learn about neural networks basics and how to start out in this field.\n————————————————————————————\nPrerequisites: \nSome machine learning will be helpful.\nKnow what are matrices.\nVectors and how to multiply them.\nSome programming experience.\n————————————————————————————\nDate:\nFriday,  September 23, 2016 – 9:00 PM\n————————————————————————————\nDuration: \n1 hour and 30 mins\n————————————————————————————\nBio:\nHazem Nomer is a Master student at Faculty of Science, Alexandria University doing research in deep learning and neural networks. Since my senior year, I have used recurrent nets and lstms (special types of neural networks) in forecasting stock returns, adaptive user interfaces, news headlines generation and recommendation.\n————————————————————————————\nLocation:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CATHangouts\n————————————————————————————\nFor more information about the session :\nhttp://catreloaded.org/activities/Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Nets/\n————————————————————————————\nVisit our website for more activities:\nhttp://catreloaded.org/activities/#section-3","created_time":"2016-09-23T22:46:29+10:00","total_likes":8,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1239582719414767","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abo Mazin","id":"1337260053029891"},"message":"شغال على application مستخدم فية ال firebase ك realtime database \nبس المشكلة انى لم بستخدم FirebaseRecyclerAdapter عشان احمل ال Data فى ال Recycleview عامل شرط اشوف هل ال view اللى هيتحط دة واخد property معينة لو مش واخدها بعمل setvisible بتاعة ب Gone وفعلا ال View بيتشال بس بيسيب المكان بتاعة موجود فى ال Recycleview حد عندة حل ؟؟؟","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-09-24T00:27:31+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1232625100110529","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mozaly","id":"10154444669171313"},"message":"بواجه مشاكل معقدة -وبتحصل على ال production- صعب تتحل بسرعة من غير معرفة مسار الكود، ال miniprofiler حل جزء من المشكلة بس مش بيقدر يوفر صورة واضحة عن مسار الكود\n--\nحد احتاج يعمل حاجة زي كدة؟\nحد جرب PostCharp ؟","caption":"stackoverflow.com","description":"I am having a hard time tracking down a lock issue, so I would like to log every method call's entry and exit.
