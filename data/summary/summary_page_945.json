Consider you have the following code in C and you are using a 32bit system:\n\nfloat a = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n    a++;\n    if (a > 16777216) break;\n}\n\nWhen do you think the loop will stop?\nBy the way the float32 range is: -3.4E+38 to +3.4E+38. This means 3.4 * 10^38 to -3.4 * 10^38. So this value is in range\n\nHow about this code in go:\n\nvar f float32 = 16777216 // 1 << 24\nfmt.Println(f == f+1)\n\nWhat is the expected result?\n\nWell the first C code will result in an infinite loop! The second go code will result in printing `true`!\n\nIf you want to know why in short read this answer in stackoverflow:\n","caption":"stackoverflow.com","description":"float a = 0; while (true) { a++; if (a > 16777216) break; // Will never break... a stops at 16777216 } Can anyone explain this to me why a float value stops incrementing at 167...","created_time":"2016-08-03T05:28:33+10:00","total_likes":6,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1194803297226043","from":{"name":"Mohamed A.
