I think Twitter already supports HTTP2 (but I'm not sure).\n- So far, HTTP2 will allow for non-SSL connection. There's a push to make SSL/TLS required for all connection (which I'm in a favor of, I have to say).\n- Main goal seems to be to reduce number of trips between server and client.\nHe put together a PDF with all the details. Check it out. It's not all technical details but also history of HTTP and how we got here.\nhttp://daniel.haxx.se/http2/","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-06-09T22:44:10-07:00","total_likes":12,"total_comments":8},{"id":"172338516139198_761121350594242","from":{"id":"503715261","name":"Ahmed Fathalla"},"message":"I have a thought that I wanted to share with you guys.
