Diab & originally suggested by the journalist Ismail Al Eskandarani. The idea is to convert the book of the same name[2] to an interactive map with rich info & images. It allows end-users to enter the data.\n\nBecause of the nature of the app & that Egyptians rarely do crowd-sourcing, my budget for hosting the initial version is zero. Also I will put ads in there, so if the site gets a lot of traffic, it can cover its own hosting  money.\n\nLet's dive in technicality: In the beginning I thought that I would make it a static website hosted on gh-pages & use GitHub for editing geojson, but GitHub uses maps for viewing only, not editing. Also, GitHub is not Egyptian-end-users-friendly.\n\nNow I have to make a dynamic part, so there are the options in my head now\n\n1. Use gh-pages for the front-end & a small back-end to edit geojson & upload images to github. I'm still thinking of the best way to do authentication.\n\n2. Make a dynamic app on AppEngine. I get a free instance, but I will be locked.\n\n3. Make a dynamic app on Heroku (or a similar thing?). I want a free instance with DB storage.\n\n4. What is the best option to store images? Flickr gives 1TB free, but I'm open to suggestions\n\n[1]: https://github.com/mtayseer/cairo_streets_stories\n[2]: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289626","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-27T04:44:19-07:00","total_likes":12,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_720816357958075","from":{"id":"549230375","name":"Ahmed Magdy"},"message":"JavaScript Equality Table\nhttp://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-27T02:16:56-07:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_721180947921616","from":{"id":"740765313","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"},"message":"MVEL is a very good and cool project if you are using a JVM based language and you want to provide either full scripting language support or just minor predicates parser\\interpreter support.\nI am using it now, and it is pretty solid.","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-27T20:54:58-07:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_721294397910271","from":{"id":"100002853561259","name":"Julia Safi"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-28T03:26:21-07:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_720540471318997","from":{"id":"100001024709106","name":"Ebrahim Hamdy"},"message":"i have created a login an signup page , and i want to display user information after signup or login ! , but i don't how !, have anyone have a way or solution to do that !?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-26T10:28:43-07:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":16},{"id":"172338516139198_721334501239594","from":{"id":"730480176","name":"Tamer Zaki"},"message":"Juniors & Seniors .Net software engineers needed, if you are interested contact me tamer.zaki@linkdev.com","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-28T05:46:26-07:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0}]}
