I'm running a thing on Windows 10, and according to Docs, the version I use (AbcPDF 9) supports IE11.\n\nBut some styles (only few of them) are not applied. I could spot a case where things like \":not(.some-class)\" isn't working, although it's working in normal page when opened in IE11.\n\nI looked for options, saw Selectivizr, but it seems to do nothing (I think I load it correctly, after jQuery and styles).\n\nMy assumption is that AbcPdf is working in some earlier IE mode or something. Is there any other option that adds the \":not()\" etc selectors to earlier IE?\n\nOr maybe, is there any way I can make sure AbcPDF is using the full capabilities of IE11 installed?\n\nThanks.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-15T11:13:48+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":4},{"id":"172338516139198_1098106236895750","from":{"name":"Mohammed Hussien","id":"10154099730567024"},"message":"عندي فكرة كويسة ياريت نستخدمها في الجروب برغم ان فيه ناس كتير بتعمل كدة في الجروب بس اهو حبيت اشارك معاكم ونحاول نعممها .. لو كل بوست يبقي فيه هاش تاج خاص بالموضوع علشان بعد كدة يسهل عملية البحث جوه الجروب وانك ممكن كمان تدخل تشوف كل الجديد في موضوع معين باختصار.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-15T08:14:33+11:00","total_likes":11,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1099495143423526","from":{"name":"Muhammad Kamal","id":"394546230905395"},"message":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56GLRXxh88","caption":"youtube.com","description":"FOR REASONS WHY I DID NOT ADD A PURELY FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SEE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxgKyX_Eg6w It's time to start talking about the f...","created_time":"2016-03-17T05:05:29+11:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1098564296849944","from":{"name":"Abdelrahman Elkady","id":"1328679870533293"},"message":"Anyone having problems with GitHub today ? \n\nSpecially the graphs section","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-16T00:16:37+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":3},{"id":"172338516139198_1099117636794610","from":{"name":"Mohamed Fergany","id":"10212218310718439"},"message":"ايه افضل شركة ممكن ناخد منها bulk sms لمصر بسعر كويس غير sms masr ؟ \nوليها api . ولو بتتعامل مع شركة كام سعر الرسالة ؟\nسعر الرسالة في sms masr عشرين قرش بس عندهم مشاكل في توصيل الرسايل بالليل فهل من حل تاني بسعر كويس ؟","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-16T18:10:03+11:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":17},{"id":"172338516139198_1099702850069422","from":{"name":"Ibrahim Mohammed","id":"1726284604348944"},"message":"Facebook loads the videos even if you didn't open them, all the videos on my feed is loading like that at the same time.. anyone have the same issue ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-17T11:02:49+11:00","total_likes":5,"total_comments":12},{"id":"172338516139198_1100006213372419","from":{"name":"Mohammed Morsi","id":"10212986144227875"},"message":"Hi Everyone,\nWe have a meetup for designers.
