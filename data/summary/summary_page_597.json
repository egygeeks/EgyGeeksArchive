Should I keep it as a VM? Any ideas? thoughts?\n\nAdvantages of VM:\n\n1. Small \n2. Transferable\n3. Will contain all my software and configurations\n4. I have enough RAM to offer it great performance.\n5. Ubuntu only takes 450 MB when it starts anyway, so starting  #! in VM is negligible in performance difference than if I started it native.\n6. A 10 GB VM contains all my software  and learning needs. Easily transferable via USB and can just be ready to start again on any machine.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n1. It feels more organic just to boot it as main OS.\n2. It consumes few resources so I can use it as my VM host. (150 MB at start)\n3. It will relax my OCD tendencies to make it a full install.\n4. Full install won't be transferable.\n5. The lack of visual candy is relaxing to my brain, I actually feel so much better without it.\n\nAnyway, please share your thoughts with me, this is one of the few times in my life that I can't make a clear decision an it's killing me.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2015-01-30T13:40:58+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":18},{"id":"172338516139198_888374681202241","from":{"name":"Adel K.
