Developers started test driving the bugs because it makes much more sense than test driving bug-free code. Finally, we are measuring the business value of each bug in terms of customer feedback and prioritize the bugs based on the experience we think they create.”","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-03T17:49:37+03:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_709536332419411","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":null,"caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","description":null,"created_time":"2014-03-03T19:21:55+03:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_709550555751322","from":{"id":"1755401963","name":"Abdullah El-menawy"},"message":"#DevMix","caption":"devmix.org","description":"VisualVM is a graphical user interface enables developers to quickly and easily view information about multiple Java applications.VisualVM provides detailed information about Java applications while they are running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
