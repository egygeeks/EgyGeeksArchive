The developer and SysAdmin at StackOverflow? He's just published a blog post about the entire infrastructure behind StackOverflow the 2016 edition.\nHe mentioned earlier and I'm quoting him \"One of the reasons I love working at Stack Overflow is we’re encouraged to talk about almost anything out in the open. Except for things companies always keep private like financials and the nuclear launch codes, everything else is fair game.\". Usually he posts on Twitter screenshot from their database monitoring server containing table names, row counts and sizes. This approach is very nice. Also the fact that StackOverflow is served from only 11 webservers is awesome!\nFollow this guy and his blog. This post is a first in a series. \nhttps://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-02-18T09:02:31+11:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":1}]}
