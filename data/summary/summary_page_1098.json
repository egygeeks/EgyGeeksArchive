I put both of them in contact and then what happened  was really shocking for me. That young man seeking the internship called me to tell me that the company would require him to pay for that internship (13000+ EGP). \nSince I never encountered a situation like this, I am really shocked and disgusted. I wish to ask your opinions about what happened, and should I remove the job post or not ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-01-13T20:46:58+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":17},{"id":"172338516139198_1354370394602665","from":{"name":"Ahmed Ebn El-Haj Ramzy","id":"1238084806298364"},"message":"معايا weights ل neural network و عايز اعملها import على اى neural networks library on c++\n\nفمحتاج اى اقتراحات ل libraries ينفع معاها كدة و لو حد جرب يا ريت يقولى ازاى ؟","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-01-15T01:53:01+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1354610424578662","from":{"name":"Ahmed Kh'aled","id":"1340434959359755"},"message":"حد جرب ينزله على راوتر TE-Data ؟","caption":"wiki.openwrt.org","description":null,"created_time":"2017-01-15T07:46:57+11:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":1},{"id":"172338516139198_1354685627904475","from":{"name":"Bdr Mohamed","id":"1632850470064034"},"message":"Nick Di Vona interview.\nNick Di Vona is a developer who got #2 in the AppStore with his IOS app PokeRadar which has about 2Million active users at the moment and has been sold to the famous Company Glu (The makers of \"Deer Hunter\" game and others) for 500K $ !!!!!!! \nHe talks about what he did and the story behind his outstanding success.\nThe interview could be watched by anyone but it's mobile development oriented but watch it anyway he gives general information and advices. \n","caption":"youtube.com","description":null,"created_time":"2017-01-15T09:28:50+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1354079037965134","from":{"name":"Apd Ulrhman II","id":"1766212820363297"},"message":"I have finished JAVA basics then object oriented programming (OOP), and Very good command of Android SDK, I need your advice What do I need now  to could apply as Junior Android Developer ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-01-14T18:02:20+11:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":10}]}
