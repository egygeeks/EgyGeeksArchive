In the latter case, PayPal does the conversion for a fee of about 3.66%. That's almost the same as what the Egyptian banks charge now after the latest changes (3.5%, previously was 2.5%).\n\nThere are two good things about doing this:\n1) You pay in EGP, so you're not subject to any limitations by the CBE on foreign currency payments.\n2) PayPal does the conversion, relieving the Egyptian economy from availing the foreign currency.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with PayPal and I'm not trying to promote their service, but rather trying to help solve our problem.","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-02T20:52:56+11:00","total_likes":25,"total_comments":5},{"id":"172338516139198_1090101317696242","from":{"name":"Mohammad Gabr","id":"10155162837118478"},"message":"ايه افضل hosting لموقع شركة أغلب الناس بتقول www.hostgator.com\nفيه حد عنده تجربة أحسن .. المفروض ده Static site مفيش backend ليه (HTML بس)","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-02T23:03:49+11:00","total_likes":2,"total_comments":15},{"id":"172338516139198_1090582030981504","from":{"name":"Mohammed Al Ashaal","id":"740831752757314"},"message":"some of my latest open-source projects that have been created \"just for fun\"\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[*] Axync: an asynchrounous php7 kernel based on generators .\n> https://github.com/alash3al/axync\n> language: PHP \"7.0\"\n--\n[*] Xerver: a tiny standalone static & reverse fastcgi proxy with no configs\n> https://github.com/alash3al/xerver\n> language: Go\n> binaries are available \"cross-platform\" .\n--\n[*] Googly: search google from the terminal\n> https://github.com/alash3al/googly\n> language: Go \n> binaries are available \"cross-platform\" .","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-03-03T18:36:28+11:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":1}]}
