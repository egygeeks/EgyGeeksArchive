I am looking for a recruitment advise. I have been looking for a good technical team that has experience in the open source stack and knowledge in a heterogeneous, high availability project but I still can't find them. I have budget, I want four team members in a different levels. I can't find a complete team that integrates well together and will get me the expected results. \nDid anyone face the same problem before? Shall I switch technology and start depends on the .NET stack? Shall I hire people from East Europe? I didn't start yet but I can see the risk. \nYour thoughts are highly appreciated","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-13T12:58:49+10:00","total_likes":15,"total_comments":25},{"id":"172338516139198_1124002820972758","from":{"name":"Ahmed Saleh","id":"10158326787715574"},"message":"Does anybody know about QT state machine ?","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-14T18:33:00+10:00","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_1123640794342294","from":{"name":"Morad Edwar","id":"10212482712403270"},"message":"حد طلب منى ادور على Designer  هيصمم كتيب 70 صفحة مقاس صغير واقرب لبرشور .. الشغل عبارة عن تصميم الغلاف + الصفحات الداخلية اللي عبارة عن نص ومعاه صور او خرائط .. اللي يعرف حد ياريت يمنشنه او يكلمنى على الاينبوكس وانا هوصله بالمنظمة اللى محتاجة التصميم :)","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2016-04-14T05:29:15+10:00","total_likes":0,"total_comments":6}]}
