Our new guidelines explain you should allow Googlebot to crawl the page assets (CSS, JavaScript, etc) so that we can index your content properly.\n\nLet me be super clear about what this means: By blocking crawling of CSS and JS, you're actively harming the indexing of your pages.  It's the easiest SEO you can do today. And don't forget your mobile site either!\n\nRead more in the announcement:\n\nhttp://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/10/updating-our-technical-webmaster.html\n\nand also our announcement earlier this year about using rendering as part of indexing:\n\nhttp://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/05/rendering-pages-with-fetch-as-google.html","caption":"googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com","description":"We recently announced that our indexing system has been rendering web pages more like a typical modern browser, with CSS and JavaScript turned on.
