A stack is a combination of different software versions that makes for a unique environment. Sometimes, installing a Service Pack can be a big change, so it has to have its own stack.\n- Each person, of course, can have only one stack on their own machine.\n- We do have a vCenter/vSphere solution in place and it's pretty good but we're looking to improve.\n\nHere's what we're trying do:\n- I'd like to have one VM per stack. That VM would be installed by IT (or someone assigned to that task).\n- When a support case comes in, the analyst would choose the VM that best machines their case and then creates a separate instance of that VM and give it a name related to their case number.\n- This is, of course, possible in a number of ways. Templates and Clones do this.\n- My idea was to use Linked Clones, they can save on disk space and they're very quick to create. However, I have number of problems with how linked clones are created in vSphere:\n1- They require the user to know a lot of technical details about the VM infrastructure (similar to creating new machines). It would be safer and easier to have a specialist do the cloning (which is not convenient given the big number of VM that has to be created).\n2- I'm not clear on permissions in vSphere but how can I control giving users permission to create these clones while not giving them full permissions.\n- I'd like to be able to do something like: right click -> create new instance -> Enter machine name -> Done. Basically, \"give me an instance of this machine\", like how Vagrant works.\n\nAny suggestions on vSphere (or VMware products) or any other vendor are welcomed.\nLet me know if you have any questions\n\nThanks in advance!","created_time":"2014-04-11T18:47:49+0000","total_likes":1,"total_comments":25},{"id":"172338516139198_728930090480035","from":{"id":"661261340","name":"Mohammad Tayseer"},"caption":"www.reddit.com","description":"**INTRO** http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/22ohrb/meta_how_about_weekly_contests_in_classification/ Many people expressed their int...","created_time":"2014-04-11T19:34:58+0000","total_likes":1,"total_comments":0},{"id":"172338516139198_729033423803035","from":{"id":"661261340","name":"Mohammad Tayseer"},"message":"Work in MIT","caption":"scratch.mit.edu","description":"Want to work on an innovative project that is transforming the ways young people create, share, and learn?
