I bit the bullet and flashed the latest LinageOS 14.1 experimental builds on it... it is not perfect, the camera needs improvement and few audio bugs, but other than that, a very noticeable difference in speed and experience of the very latest \"almost\" vanilla Android.\n\nInterested to hear your opinions and experiences!","caption":null,"description":null,"created_time":"2017-02-12T03:31:41+11:00","total_likes":4,"total_comments":2},{"id":"172338516139198_1387038821335822","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":null,"caption":"analyzecore.com","description":"doc2vec is a deep learning algorithm that draws context from phrases.
