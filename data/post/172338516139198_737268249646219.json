So here's a recreation http://jsfiddle.net/HNysu/1/\nIt hides the option which should work on FF and wraps the option in a hidden span to hide it on Chrome, should also in theory work on IE if I recall correctly. The hidden span trick wont work on FF because it's actually invalid HTML.\nNonetheless, this should be cross-platform. If anyone is kind enough to verify it, that'd be great.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: Just noticed a bug, if you select nothing on the category, the products list wont return to showing the full list of products.
