{"id":"172338516139198_792701910769519","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Fawzy","id":"10210168736267253"},"message":"Hey everyone, my laptop (lenovo z570 with a couple of upgrades) is failing fast (in terms of MB failures, outer chaises ugly screen resolution.... :D), and I believe it's about time for a new one. However, the issue is, with my second gen core-i5, 8GB of RAM, and a recently bought Samsung SSD on my current system, I'm generally satisfied and most of the available laptops I've seen don't really look like a true upgrade. So, I started considering a Mac Book Pro... and then I started wondering if there are better choices that I can buy for >15K. I'm pretty sure the PC world has a lot to offer for that price range. so, simply put, the question is, why should/shouldn't I buy a mac, and if not a mac, which laptop do you recommend for running ubuntu (sorry windows guys, unless I'm running OS X, there is nothing else I can use other than Linux :D) \n\n--p.s. I know it's a controversial thing, and some people take it so religiously, but I need to buy a new laptop not start a flame war :P","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/792701910769519"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/792701910769519"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-08-01T16:51:14+0000","updated_time":"2014-08-02T09:02:38+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"599122886872347","name":"Rede da Empresa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"NTk5MTIyODg2ODcyMzQ3","after":"NTk5MTIyODg2ODcyMzQ3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-08-01T16:54:54+0000","from":{"name":"Islam AbdelMohaimen Hassan","id":"10211887209872216"},"message":"Too damn expensive, are you sure you're willing to pay that much for these specs?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"792702970769413"},{"created_time":"2014-08-01T16:59:23+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Fawzy","id":"10210168736267253"},"message":"This is mainly why I started wondering :D --maho akeed ya3ni en mesh kol el Mac owners can't see any better thing to do with their hardly earned bucks, there must be something that makes people choose a Mac over a PC, I want to know that \"thing\", maybe I'll agree with it and start wondering how I've been living without a mac all this time, and maybe not, hence is my question :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"792703890769321"},{"created_time":"2014-08-01T17:04:19+0000","from":{"name":"Islam AbdelMohaimen Hassan","id":"10211887209872216"},"message":"It's supposed to have a much longer battery life, an SSD HDD and the os is really good.
