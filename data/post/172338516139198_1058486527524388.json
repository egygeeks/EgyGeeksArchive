I've been doing design for 18 years, I've  done UX, IxD, UI and Product. Although these specializations intersect, yet they are different endeavors. Those who can do the UX (full throttle) and then UI I call them unicorns, and they are very rare to find (here and in Silicon Valley as well, we do have another office there).\nI retain a high resistance to the UX/UI coined term as it's been abused by UI designers to add glitters and sparkles to their titles/resumes.\nWe apply a modified lean UX process at webkeyz, we have different teams for each speciality. I do believe the separation is in the favour of the product as each designer can focus more on what they are doing, ex: UX can focus on research, grids, navigation, validation, patterns, etc... While UI can focus on creative concept, color palette, typography, iconography, etc...
