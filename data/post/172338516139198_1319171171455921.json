Categories are saved on a different table. Both clauses and categories are editable by the user.\nWhat I want to do is to create a page where these clauses will be grouped by category. \nEach clause should have a check box next to it allowing users to choose what applies.\nI'm not sure what ASP controls to use. I thought about nested repeaters but the idea isn't appealing. \nI also think a combination of a repeater and a gridview will also complicate things. \nIt will be ideal not to show empty categories. \nI'm pretty sure you geeks will impress me :)","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1319171171455921"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1319171171455921"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-12-08T22:30:40+0000","updated_time":"2016-12-09T16:34:00+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-12-09T16:29:50+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Magdy","id":"1244338732328542"},"message":"It's more simple than using repeaters you could use a drop down for the categories and 2 list one for assigned sentences and other for unassigned looks like 2 pools","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1320361178003587"},{"created_time":"2016-12-09T16:33:59+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shawky Ibrahim","id":"10154264953431700"},"message":"I totally agree with you but I forgot to mention that the client is absolutely strict.
