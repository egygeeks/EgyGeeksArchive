I'm working with a vendor that's consuming a RESTful API I'm maintaining and every time they face a problem with the APIs and I ask them for a request sample they give me a hard time and they almost never send an actual request (header, body) nor a response. Their argument is that they can not access the raw request data because neither iOS nor Android SDKs allows them to do so. Like I said I've never touched neither iOS nor Android but I've been writing software for almost two decades under multiple environments and I find that hard to believe, Can this actually be true or are they just incompetent?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1343822795657425"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1343822795657425"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-01-02T14:42:29+0000","updated_time":"2017-01-02T18:05:51+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1364997500240454","name":"Mohamed AbuIssa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTM2NDk5NzUwMDI0MDQ1NAZDZD","after":"MTM2NDk5NzUwMDI0MDQ1NAZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-01-02T14:43:59+0000","from":{"name":"Ramy Wafa","id":"1147462558710079"},"message":"Hassan Ibraheem","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10156033879973228","length":15,"name":"Hassan Ibraheem","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1343824462323925"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T14:44:51+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Tantawy","id":"10155099548114764"},"message":"You should have some sort of middle layer like postman or swagger where both of you should use, to make sure languages/libraries/tools don't affect the requests.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1343824855657219"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T14:48:26+0000","from":{"name":"Islam AbdelMohaimen Hassan","id":"10211887209872216"},"message":"I've never needed to do it in android, and it probably need some extra work to get the raw request/response, but you can easily get each component of it like header, body, params...etc on it's own using get methods from the response object","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1343826378990400"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T14:51:41+0000","from":{"name":"Hassan Ibraheem","id":"10156033879973228"},"message":"Incompetent is the right word, if I understand you correctly.
