Especially because most of the companies that backed Apple in the backdoor issue, are involved in PRISM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) - Microsoft, Fb, and Google were among the first to back Apple's position against the FBI, and they're all in there, including Apple of course.\n\nI understand that a backdoor would be a whole other level of wtf, but I would still not be very trusting of them from a privacy POV, if at all.\n\nThoughts?","story":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10158142026600408","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}],"52":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":52,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBWBIypdHU4nwLU&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F6%2F61%2FIs_Snowden_a_Hero%253F_SnowdenHK_%25E9%25A6%2599%25E6%25B8%25AF%25E8%2581%25B2%25E6%258F%25B4%25E6%2596%25AF%25E8%25AB%25BE%25E7%2599%25BB%25E9%2581%258A%25E8%25A1%258C_Hong_Kong_Rally_to_Support_Snowden_SML.20130615.7D.42298.jpg%2F220px-Is_Snowden_a_Hero%253F_SnowdenHK_%25E9%25A6%2599%25E6%25B8%25AF%25E8%2581%25B2%25E6%258F%25B4%25E6%2596%25AF%25E8%25AB%25BE%25E7%2599%25BB%25E9%2581%258A%25E8%25A1%258C_Hong_Kong_Rally_to_Support_Snowden_SML.20130615.7D.42298.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQA1jE181OeCOIT1","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)","name":"PRISM (surveillance program) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","caption":"en.wikipedia.org","description":"PRISM is a clandestine[1]surveillance program under which the United States National Security Agency (NSA) collects internet communications from at least nine major US internet companies.[2][3][4] Since 2001 the United States government has increased its scope for such surveillance, and so this prog…","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1105608446145529"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1105608446145529"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2016-03-23T23:47:10+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-24T11:12:05+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10208614284341592","name":"Mohamed Ayman"},{"id":"10158307172615634","name":"عمر أمين"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMDg2MTQyODQzNDE1OTIZD","after":"MTAxNTgzMDcxNzI2MTU2MzQZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-03-24T01:57:58+0000","from":{"name":"Sherif Omar","id":"10158356909500092"},"message":"Its definitely good business sense, but now the FBI says there's a third party that can hack the phone, which sounds like pretty bad news for Apple","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1105707389468968"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV3TlRjd056TTRPVFEyT0RrMk9Eb3hORFU0TnpnME5qYzUZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV3TlRjd056TTRPVFEyT0RrMk9Eb3hORFU0TnpnME5qYzUZD"}}}}
