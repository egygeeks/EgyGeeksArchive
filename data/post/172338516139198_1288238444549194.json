If there is a single advice I would give anyone starting their software development career, it would be: Be a software engineer and never be biased to any language. Master the basics of computer science like data structures and algorithms and master one language really very well and then learn more languages as much as you can. PHP has tons of jobs and so is Java, Python and so are many others -  none of them is disappearing soon I guess. However good companies would be looking for good software engineers who know how to create high quality usable software. Having said that and back to the original question, trends that I see now are Big Data, Analytics, and IoT as far as I know but better to find good sources for good companies such as Gartener or LinkedIn who do research based on Business trends or job markets These are trends that are having growth now however old mainstream is there and will continue to exist.
