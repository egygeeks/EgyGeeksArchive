On the process it self you will be forced to break down hypothetical function to testable small pieces witch actually eases later on writing the functionality it self \nExample : \nWrite a function calls api retrieve data according to a parameter and returns filtered results according to another parameter.\n Tests:\n1. Function exists\n2. Can call api with 200 response \n3. If parameters type are wrong or undefined\nEtc.. \nWhen your write your function later it will be a walk in a park because you're already know what to do.\n\n2. Second major reason is simple to have as much as you can code base covered with tests so when every time you add one more feature you will make sure it doesn't ruin something else.","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1043601145679593"},{"created_time":"2015-12-11T16:40:52+0000","from":{"name":"Taha Amin","id":"10154850341220590"},"message":"https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing-second-edition","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1043741088998932"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEEwTXpVNE9UUXhOVFk0TURjMk5qb3hORFE1T0RJeU9EUTIZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEEwTXpjME1UQTRPRGs1T0Rrek1qb3hORFE1T0RVeU1EVXoZD"}}}}
