It shows the ability to use a single model to translate language pairs that the model has never been trained for. For example, training the model with Korean<->English, and Japanese<->English, allows direct (zero-shot) translation between Korean<->Japanese, without changing the model. \n\nThe article cites this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04558v1.pdf and they have nice visualizations and possibly new insights about what the model is actually \"learning\" about the language (semantics vs direct phrase/phrase translation). Very interesting. \n\nhttps://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html","story":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10158142026600408","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}],"52":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":52,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBCyHAihMf_alKW&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-jwgtcgkgG2o%2FWDSBrwu9jeI%2FAAAAAAAABbM%2F2Eobq-N9_nYeAdeH-sB_NZGbhyoSWgReACLcB%2Fw1200-h630-p-nu%2Fimage01.gif&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAK9isttd9TXMJW","link":"https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html","name":"Zero-Shot Translation with Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System","caption":"research.googleblog.com","description":"Posted by Mike Schuster (Google Brain Team), Melvin Johnson (Google Translate) and Nikhil Thorat (Google Brain Team) In the last 10 years,...","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1306908812682157"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1306908812682157"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2016-11-28T18:38:30+0000","updated_time":"2016-11-28T18:38:31+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1983274388365006","name":"Mohamed Hisham"},{"id":"1379135742108438","name":"Abdelrahman Ghanem"},{"id":"10158378182000174","name":"Hazem Salem"},{"id":"10158307172615634","name":"عمر أمين"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTk4MzI3NDM4ODM2NTAwNgZDZD","after":"MTAxNTgzMDcxNzI2MTU2MzQZD"}}}}
