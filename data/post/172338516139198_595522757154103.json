and you can customize it as you wish. normally the jQuery plugins offers you more than what you need and you Tax the website visitor by loading a plugin that you only need small parts of it and the rest is just living out there :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"596135110426201"},{"created_time":"2013-07-19T21:19:23+0000","from":{"name":"Abdelrady

shouldn't bother your self coding stuff are already done. it depends on your use case. if you are working on a small project use as much as jquery plugins hahahaha but if you want to build a maintainable website and well documented code that can help people after you to understand everything without the need to go to a jquery plugin page you won't use jQuery plugins.\n\nAnother reason is why to have a plugin that might or might not work in the next jquery release or even after 5 releases while you use pure javascript and you willnever worry about updating it
