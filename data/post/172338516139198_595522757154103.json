it as you wish. normally the jQuery plugins offers you more than what you need and you Tax the website visitor by loading a plugin that you only need small parts of it and the rest is just living out there :)","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2013-07-19T21:15:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"596136467092732","from":{"id":"1246823411","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},"message":"well you have a point, but don't forget that you can use CDNs, and most of the time the user browser have it(JQuery) from other websites \n& regarding the user experience, why do i bother my self coding stuff

to build a maintainable website and well documented code that can help people after you to understand everything without the need to go to a jquery plugin page you won't use jQuery plugins.\n\nAnother reason is why to have a plugin that might or might not work in the next jquery release or even after 5 releases while you use pure javascript and you willnever worry about updating it

will see that we are returning back to use pure js in a better way. jQuery actually was made for people (was like me) who hated javascript and just needed to be able to do cool javascript stuff like
