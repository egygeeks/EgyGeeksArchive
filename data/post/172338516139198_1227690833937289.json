I am going to be the person who changes that so I'm trying to come up with the whole process. I have researched few things but not sure which way to go:\n- Continue using Microsoft SQL Management Studio for all the DB work and just connect it with TFS and check in the change scripts.\nOR\n- Abandon the Management studio and use Microsoft Visual studio (we have 2013) for the DB design, edit, and so on. And this way I can use TFS to keep the DB under control. \nI'm open to all suggestions, but be mindful we are really trying to keep it inside the Microsoft house.\nThank you all.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1227690833937289"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1227690833937289"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-09-09T21:12:20+0000","updated_time":"2016-09-10T11:55:29+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1652191298131673","name":"Mohammed Yassin"},{"id":"10158368177130608","name":"Ahmed AboZaid"},{"id":"10155058995938618","name":"Emad Mahdy"},{"id":"10153772116414364","name":"Sarab Alzaman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTY1MjE5MTI5ODEzMTY3MwZDZD","after":"MTAxNTM3NzIxMTY0MTQzNjQZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-09-09T23:36:31+0000","from":{"name":"Abdelrahman Ghareeb","id":"10154835351896005"},"message":"I'm not familiar with Microsoft's stack whatsoever so this is just a generic thought on the subject. What you have to keep in mind when dealing with database designs is how they evolve over time, so initially you have to document your data models obviously and generate scripts to create those models as a database schema, those designs go into your source control along with the migration scripts you will use to modify the database design while maintaining data integrity to minimize migration/updates time. Whichever tool you can use to achieve automated database creation and migration is the tool you should use, any extra features are a matter of taste IMHO..\n\nCheers","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1227796740593365"},{"created_time":"2016-09-10T00:11:16+0000","from":{"name":"Kofi Kotga","id":"1353622064681019"},"message":"We using Vault and had to put every script on it..i hope there are better solutions","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1227815927258113"},{"created_time":"2016-09-10T00:42:42+0000","from":{"name":"Basem Mostafa","id":"10212154827376546"},"message":"We use flyway, basically devs create sql scripts or code to update the DB and flyway manage the process of upgrading the DB structure.
