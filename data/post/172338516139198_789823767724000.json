I am trying to create a dynamic Force-Directed Graph (like this: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045). It works just fine till the number of the nodes grow. I need to be able to dynamically set the radius of the nodes according to the total amount of nodes in the graph.\nMany thanks","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/789823767724000"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/789823767724000"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-07-26T21:39:21+0000","updated_time":"2014-07-27T00:10:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"583123872","name":"Mohammed Abbas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgzMTIzODcy","before":"NTgzMTIzODcy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"789831307723246","from":{"id":"100006020376039","name":"Mostafa Hussein"},"message":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم","message_tags":[{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16}],"can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-07-26T22:00:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"789832847723092","from":{"id":"595125669","name":"Ahmad Alfy"},"message":"I followed somehow an ugly hack ...
