On another note, a technical only manager can fail by great deals in situations like the one Mohamed has mentioned... a business person with an IT background (even if they don't code), or a technical person with business experience make the best managers in these cases, yet they're the developer's worst nightmare, for obvious reasons :p","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"859089010797475"},{"created_time":"2014-12-10T23:32:13+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Tayseer","id":"10154965677956341"},"message":"His background is not important as his foreground: knowing himself, trusting other people, treating others well.

Working with a non-techie puts a responsibility on me to explain things in simplified terms.\n\n2. If he doesn't believe me, then it's a matter of trust. Why did he accept to work with me if he doesn't trust me?\n\n3. You might say that he doesn't know me to trust me. I would reply & say that he doesn't know me to accuse me of lying to him.\n\n4. I would also tell him that I can satisfy him & give him a small estimate & he will be happy for now, but at the end my estimate is the realistic one. We will be late, he will lose money & at some point in time he will close his company or layoff half of his employees. He will also lose the trust of the client.\n\n5. For all of this to happen, I must do my best to make the estimates realistic. Two stories to mention here\n\nI was working with a non-techie client on a freelance project & I put the delivery date after 2 months. When he said that it's very late, I told him that the reason is that I can work for 6-8 hours per week. He asked me to make the deadline closer (& hence work more hours per week). This needed more time & family management (& he knew this), but I made it for him in the end.\n\nAnother story with a techie manager - who didn't trust me then. He objected that I made 2 weeks as an estimate. I showed him the detailed schedule of tasks, assigned time, execution plan & buffer time. He said that the _standard_ for a buffer can't exceed 25%. I told him that 30% is more realistic according to my experience. He changed the buffer percentage, to find out that it only saved him 2 hours only! At the end we kept my estimate.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"859155950790781"},{"created_time":"2014-12-10T23:57:58+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Mohammad Tayseer But the PM I mentioned here i the comments wouldn't believe either of us :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154965677956341","length":16,"name":"Mohammad Tayseer","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"859156524124057"},{"created_time":"2014-12-11T00:01:26+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Tayseer","id":"10154965677956341"},"message":"I can't work with someone who doesn't trust me","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"859157407457302"},{"created_time":"2014-12-11T00:02:35+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Yeah, but you don't always have teh choice.
