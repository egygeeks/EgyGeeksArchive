All from compilers to JS or CSS and servers to task runners and test framework runners, even lightweight HTTP servers etc.\n\nSince there are so many people doing web UI, the NPM package registry (think Nuget gallery for Node) has quickly grown to become (arguably) the biggest package library in the world.\n\nEven. NET uses Node now for UI tasks in .NET Core instead of ASPnet Optimisation framework.\n\nNode is also lightweight and cross platform (OS). .NET Core has that, but it's not as mature as the several years old Node which has evolved a lot in the past years and sure doesn't have as large ecosystem.\n\nGiven most of the web runs on Linux, and .NET Core only existed recently (and still young), many companies who wanted just a lightweight framework they can run multiple instances of behind a simple load balancing server like what nginx provides, found Node to be perfect for that.\n\nExisting developers were able to just jump on it no matter what background they had because 1. It's JS 2.
