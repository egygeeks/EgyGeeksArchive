Wordpress didn't start where it's currently at. It started as a small blog system, didn't even make it into a fully extendable blog engine until sometime later.\nSo start at the base, grow from there. If it's a blog engine you intend on building, then build a blog first. Going from there on, is a rather steep climb uphill.\nLike Amr Eldib and Muhammad Negm have suggested, contribute to some small open source project first. Build on top of something already existing and carry on from there.\n\nI've yet to find a book or a group of books that are comprehensive enough to teach you about software design and architecture, it's a rather broad topic. Multidisciplinary and to know enough about it is to spend a life time engineering software.\nEverybody starts somewhere, so start small and grow from there. You'll pick up a lot along the way.\n\nGood luck.","message_tags":[{"id":"652024918","name":"Amr Eldib","type":"user","offset":400,"length":9},{"id":"1335906613","name":"Muhammad Negm","type":"user","offset":414,"length":13}],"can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-08-27T20:29:07+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":true},{"id":"805436029496107","from":{"id":"1073175527","name":"Mohammed Ezzat"},"message":"you've put me on the road, big thanks guys :) :)","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-08-27T20:35:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"805436202829423","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"Here's a good start, it's 2 years old but that's what a quick search on Github would yield \"blog language:php\".
