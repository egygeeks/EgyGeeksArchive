a programming language, it's a scripting language\n- Javascript is not a programming language, it's a scripting language\n\n- Front-end engineering/development =/= Web design in layman's terms. The term is rather broad and is used in many contexts for different reasons, but for the sake of what's written; you've already covered part of it with HTML/CSS & Javascript and it's not limited to UI development.\n\n- Ruby on Rails and Django are not languages, they're frameworks and Joomla, Wordpress and the likes are not frameworks. \n\nJoomla is what we call a CMF (Content management frameworks) It does build on top of an MVC framework that can be used separately but that's irrelevant to calling Joomla itself a web framework.\n\nAnd Wordpress is an extendable blog engine. Both of which are far from a what a web framework is all about.\n\n- MySQL is not a programming language for programming databases, MySQL is a database product, SQL is also not a programming language but a data query language.\n\nBest of luck.","can_remove":false,"like_count":8,"message_tags":[{"id":"10211388252395873","length":11,"name":"Ahmed Tarek","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"728221943884183"},{"created_time":"2014-04-10T20:52:31+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Tarek","id":"10211388252395873"},"message":"Thank you Hady Ahmed for your feedback yes there are many errors , but I think PHP is a scripting language also used as general purpose programming language :) , also i didn't say that JS is limited to UI development I already said that you can make client side web applications using JS :)\nI will correct the errors","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10210684524123349","length":10,"name":"Hady Ahmed","offset":10,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"728373077202403"},{"created_time":"2014-04-10T21:04:57+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Tarek","id":"10211388252395873"},"message":"JS , PHP , Ruby and Python are programming languages but they don't require a compiler as you know you can look up for their definitions on wiki ^_^","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"728376867202024"},{"created_time":"2014-04-10T23:48:41+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"You're most welcome, happy to help. However.. you left me no choice :)\n\nThe usage of php as a general purpose programming language is still very much limited by design.\n\nI didn't say JS is limited to UI. \nI said front-end is not limited to UI. There is a lot that goes into front-end engineering aside UI.\n\nJS is not a programming language and never will be.\nAgain, PHP is a scripting language.\n\nA programming language can be compiled and/or interpreted. \n\nIt's the:\n- Purpose\n- Intention & Intended usage\n- Design \n- Most common usage \n- Implementation scope and breadth \n\nthat decide whether it's indeed a feature-full programming language useable for the design and implementation of any and all kinds of systems or not.\n\nCompilers and interpreters are _implementation details_\n\n**Languages are neither compiled nor interpreted** \n\nThe implementation decides that. \n\nPython code in most cases is  _compiled_ into bytecode which gets _interpreted_ by CPython.\n\nJIT compiled by PyPy, so that's machine code right there.\n\nThere are implementations for .NET (IronPython), JVM bytecode (Jython)\n\nRuby code can be compiled to native code (MacRuby) or through Rubinius, the standard MRI is an interpreter.\n\nv8 snapshots compiles your JS code to machine code and lets you distribute executable binaries. \n\nHowever (since JS is a _scripting language by design_) the code is included with the binary, loaded in memory. Why? Because calling a toString on a JS function will spit out its code.\n\nThe spectrum of compilers and interpreters is wide, majority of languages are either compiled and/or interpreted, there's always a mix.\n\nMaybe esoteric languages are an exception but heck, there are brainfuck implementations that compile to machine code. \nYou can interpret brainfuck in 50+ lines of ruby code.\n\nJS, PHP = scripting languages\nRuby, Python = general purpose programming languages\n\nGood luck.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"728520737187637"},{"created_time":"2014-04-11T01:23:30+0000","from":{"name":"Hassan Aly Selim","id":"10155071713202292"},"message":"Hady Ahmed: well I have to say that some developers consider scripting languages to be a subset of programming languages, I'm NOT one of these people, but they exist :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10210684524123349","length":10,"name":"Hady Ahmed","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"728549220518122"},{"created_time":"2014-04-11T01:34:22+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"Hassan Aly Selim it saddens me when I meet them.
