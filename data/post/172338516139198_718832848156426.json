There are many impressive results using deep learning in many kaggle competitions (examples: http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/02/deep-learning-wins-dogs-vs-cats-competition.html and http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/31/merck-competition-results-deep-nn-and-gpus-come-out-to-play/ ). I also recommend checking prof. Hinton's course on Coursera (Neural Networks for Machine Learning https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets). It was offered only once back in 2012. But the course materials are still open and anyone can learn on his own.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"720128891360155"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekl3TVRJNE9Ea3hNell3TVRVMU9qRXpPVFUzTnpJNU9UQT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekl3TVRJNE9Ea3hNell3TVRVMU9qRXpPVFUzTnpJNU9UQT0ZD"}}}}
