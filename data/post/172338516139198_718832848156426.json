There are many impressive results using deep learning in many kaggle competitions (examples: http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/02/deep-learning-wins-dogs-vs-cats-competition.html and http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/31/merck-competition-results-deep-nn-and-gpus-come-out-to-play/ ). I also recommend checking prof. Hinton's course on Coursera (Neural Networks for Machine Learning https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets). It was offered only once back in 2012. But the course materials are still open and anyone can learn on his own.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-03-25T18:43:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOekl3TVRJNE9Ea3hNell3TVRVMU9qRXpPVFUzTnpJNU9UQTZMVEU9","before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOekl3TVRJNE9Ea3hNell3TVRVMU9qRXpPVFUzTnpJNU9UQTZMVEU9"}}}}
