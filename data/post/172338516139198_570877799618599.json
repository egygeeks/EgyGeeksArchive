If you are not interested in heavy editing features (e.g. can do with Movie Maker, which works for many people, like Mohamed Hossam, or if you are recording offline events with no editing, which my company has been doing for a while), you can get SnagIt for 1/6 the price (~ $50 instead of ~ $300). For free options, CamStudio seems to be the most common option, although doesn't work nicely with some microphones.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2013-05-27T08:54:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTcxMDU0OTc5NjAwODgx","before":"NTcwODgxNDA2Mjg0OTA1"}}}}
