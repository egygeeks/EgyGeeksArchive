I have one comment on SignalR\nSignalR uses websockets (for low-latency bi-directional communication between server and client, which is good) .. \nWebsockets are connection-oriented; this means one point of failure and less scalability for the server-side. I don't know how SignalR (or similar libs) handles failure. But one solution is to use in-memory store from the server side like Redis. It's fast, because it's in-memory. It's reliable because it has dump. You can replicate it to have read scalability. You can partition its data to get write scalability. \nThat's why for high scalability, I may prefer http-based communication. what do you think?","message_tags":[{"id":"652024918","name":"Amr Eldib","type":"user","offset":7,"length":9}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T14:36:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675172305855814","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":"I'm not sure if Socket.io is supported in .NET or not","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T18:01:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675178625855182","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"Designing for failure is an architectural decision not the responsibility of an infrastructural technology and isn't certainly provided out of the box for most cases.\nBy your definition that WebSockets are connection-oriented (stateful) thus they are prune to SPOFs should also be extended to HTTP. HTTP is an application layer protocol, it's underlaying implementation is built on TCP which is a stateful transport layer protocol.\n\nThat doesn't mean HTTP can't be implemented on any other transport protocol, most application layer protocols assume reliability, ensured delivery, error tracking and recovery which TCP as a transport layer protocol promises.\n\nThat being said, by your definition; the problem still persists. Whether your communication layer is designed to be stateful or stateless, doing http requests alone wouldn't mitigate the risk of a server melt down. In fact, it's likely to amplify it.\n\nWhy? Because of the very nature of http being stateless, regardless of the transport protocol it's running on. Stateless means you can't keep a bi-directional connection opened long enough for the entire session. Which poses a problem, the handshake is expensive. It certainly depends on your architecture, server of choice and network configurations, but it's safe to assume the initiation of the connection, the request handling, request processing, connection teardown and all the roundtrips in between will likely melt your server.\n\nDifferent http servers handle connections differently, as such will have different memory footprints. Your eventual goal is to keep your backlog empty, your ram free and your cpu responsive.\n\nI can't see how Redis fits in the current problem domain, you'll eventually need to transport data back and forth between a browser and a server. Redis wont help you with that. Redis can come handy when your architecture starts branching multiple server daemons, multiple services and multiple boxes, then redis can be used as a reliable message bus or a backend for a message bus. In either way, it's out of the scope of the problem at hand here.\n\nIt's your responsibility to design for scalability, both on client and server sides. Using a WebSocket server, or doing it old school with plain http requests (long-polling is one alternative), if your server goes down the client will still get affected. It's your job to detect a connection failure, reinitiate the connection, notify the user...etc.\n\nOn the server side, you'll definitely need to branch out, dedicated boxes for each service (http, application, database, cache) you'll need to balance your load, so you'll likely design a routing mesh upfront and implement reverse proxies. One node fails, another is reachable, it's seamless for the client since you're already handling such cases. You'll likely keep some data cached in memory for such service disruptions, or dumped to a file (redis clusters can be configured for such stuff)...etc. \n\nYou'll need to re-architect your approach to data storage, data duplication and data loss. So you'll be dealing with a lot of database sharding. If you got persistent sessions, you'll need to worry about sticky sessions.\n\nI mean, list goes on really... Scalability is an architecture not a feature, concurrency is a design which can either be given for free (erlang/otp, scala/akka) or left for you to handle.\n\nIt has nothing to do with WebSockets vs. Comet (Ajax based long-polling, Hidden iframes...etc.)\n\nHope this super lengthly comment helps.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T18:22:45+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675206389185739","from":{"id":"1486650909","name":"Khaled M.

BTW, I think you're right that scalability is an architecture choice.\nFor Http, we forget about KeepAlive (http1.1). If it's used, then we can get rid of most of connection initiation overhead\n\nFor redis part, I think it can be used to store client/server connection information. and then the server handles transport when \"wakes up\" from failure ..\n\nFor the \"It has nothing to do with WebSockets vs. Comet\". This depends on the server implementation, if scalable or not.\n\nAlso, you may have a look at HTTP2.0 and SPDY, they use the same http semantics but with better performance. Also, htt2.0 introduces the server push.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T19:30:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675421462497565","from":{"id":"100006641402661","name":"Mahmoud Mahdy"},"message":"i find this  websotckt supported for .net  \nhttp://xsockets.net/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-26T05:41:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675483669158011","from":{"id":"1351991293","name":"Moђameđ Ebieđ"},"message":"yes i would recommend SignalR","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-26T08:29:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc1NDgzNjY5MTU4MDEx","before":"Njc0OTQ4ODU5MjExNDky"}}}}
