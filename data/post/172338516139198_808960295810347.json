You'll need something called fixtures, a test fixture is a consistent state of which you test your software against. \n\nThis state can be data expected to have been there in one test scenario, like testing Exists on a populated repo, could be a scenario were an entity does exist but corrupted or a partial entity or a scenario where it's just not there.\n\nSo tl;dr;\nYou'll need setup and teardown methods which will load your fixtures and clean up after that.
