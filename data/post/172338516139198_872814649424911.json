About your question Randa Hisham.\n\nTo be honest, I was hosting the app on a personal computer and was a part of a network.\n\nBut generally, Node.js creates it's own process (web server) and listens on a particular port. You won't need Apache at all. In fact if you want to host a Node.js application on apache you'll have to do some work. \n\nSo you can host a Node.js app nearly on any server but it varies in the difficulty to get it running. \n\n1 -  You can just run Node.js by itself on a server without apache and tell it to listen on a certain port.. But you'll have to manage error handling and stuff like that. Becaus if an exception is thrown and not handled the process of the application stops and will not be responding until you restart that process. \n\nYou'll have to make sure also that no other application on your server is using the same port node is using. especially if you're using web sockets.\n\n2 - You can use Node.js in combination with nginx to create proxies i think in order to prevent any port blocking (not really sure if this is the only benefit )\n\n3 - You can host it on Apache, But you'll have to do some Virtual Hosts stuff. Not really sure.\n\n4 - You can use PaaS or IaaS, Which handles nearly every server maintenance task. Like rebooting in case of an exception, load balancing, deployment and starting/stopping your app.\n\nPaaS is like Heroku and Nodejitsu \nIaaS is like Amazone AWS\n\nNote: I did some researches before and readings to get this information.
