I'm evaluating between 2 alternatives: 1) PHP and 2) NodeJS. I know deciding is a pretty subjective topic, so let me tell you the criteria I'm basing off the decision and I'd love to hear your comments. I'm leaning towards NodeJS but there is nothing better than collective wisdom especially among such a group of GEEKS :)\n\nCriteria:\n1) Availability of Skill Set: PHP is more abundant especially in Egypt but NodeJS is growing rapidly\n2) Fit for application: NodeJS parallelism beats PHP on that front\n3) Market Presence: PHP is leading of course but NodeJS is growing pretty fast\n4) Ease of Coding: NodeJS is faster in the development cycle\n5) Cost to Outsource: NodeJS tend to be more expensive just because they are less. But I think prices will converge pretty soon and more importantly a developer updating his/her skill set to cope with the market is likely to deliver better results as he keeps developing him/her self so price for quality should be the same or NodeJS would exceed in that bit\n\nAs mentioned, It's a pretty subjective pick but I'd love to hear your feedbacks and please mention other criteria that I might have missed.\n(PS I'll post the requirement for someone to help build the codebase on EgyptianGeeksJobs when my membership is confirmed and I take the final decision)\n\nAwaiting replies (and sorry for the long post)","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1242058952500477"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1242058952500477"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-09-26T10:59:04+0000","updated_time":"2016-09-27T07:14:11+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1405659576121876","name":"Mahmoud Elshamy"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTQwNTY1OTU3NjEyMTg3NgZDZD","after":"MTQwNTY1OTU3NjEyMTg3NgZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-09-26T11:06:35+0000","from":{"name":"Hesham Watany","id":"10211830164526211"},"message":"PHP/Laravel (Y)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1242065055833200"},{"created_time":"2016-09-26T12:40:45+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Nabil Mahmoud","id":"10154313147241512"},"message":"NodeJS much easier","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1242141835825522"},{"created_time":"2016-09-26T20:24:35+0000","from":{"name":"Hussein Osman","id":"10212632761719282"},"message":"I can help u as freelancer \nI'm full stack \nPhp & node \nAngular + bootstrap","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1242477845791921"},{"created_time":"2016-09-27T07:14:08+0000","from":{"name":"أحمد محمود محمد عبدالوهاب","id":"10154319137941186"},"message":"if the project is big, things can get complicated with writing a lot of javascript.
