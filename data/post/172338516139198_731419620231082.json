It's merely calling a set of standard REST web services in a large scale, so I'm looking for the most lightweight, performant, and uncluttered way of doing it. My current options are:\n\n1. Visual Studio as an IDE (productive), KDevelop and CMake to generate linux native executable (the most appealing option until now)\n\n2.  C++.NET and Mono. It unlock the power of .NET, yet still concerned about performance and Mono support on the long run \n\nWhat you think?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/731419620231082"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/731419620231082"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-04-15T18:41:23+0000","updated_time":"2014-04-17T03:28:42+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-04-15T18:59:13+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Elsherif","id":"10158483817400314"},"message":"I think if you have access to SublimeText it is my favorite, you can always configure it to build using whatever command line utility you want.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"731428820230162"},{"created_time":"2014-04-15T20:32:29+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Ibrahim Khalil","id":"10154434352503657"},"message":"I didn't work with .Net frameworks before.
