It's merely calling a set of standard REST web services in a large scale, so I'm looking for the most lightweight, performant, and uncluttered way of doing it. My current options are:\n\n1. Visual Studio as an IDE (productive), KDevelop and CMake to generate linux native executable (the most appealing option until now)\n\n2.  C++.NET and Mono. It unlock the power of .NET, yet still concerned about performance and Mono support on the long run \n\nWhat you think?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/731419620231082"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/731419620231082"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-04-15T18:41:23+0000","updated_time":"2014-04-17T03:28:42+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"731428636896847","message":"if it will runs in *nix environment then you should do it with *nix toys.\nfirst option will handle that. although, you may want to give this a try if you won't use VS\nhttps://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe , with Vim, for productivity.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-04-15T18:58:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"731428820230162","from":{"id":"740765313","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"},"message":"I think if you have access to SublimeText it is my favorite, you can always configure it to build using whatever command line utility you want.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-04-15T18:59:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"731466603559717","from":{"id":"598453656","name":"Ahmed Ibrahim Khalil"},"message":"I didn't work with .Net frameworks before.
