So why would you give away your findings for free when it cost you so much?\nYou didn't get that new knowledge directly from the creator of the universe for free (you're not a prophet), you spent countless hours and without you sharing your new knowledge others would have to spend that time to acquire that new knowledge and they might not be as lucky as you.\n\nAnother aspect, you say source code is conceptually free right?\nBut that code wouldn't exist without the knowledge and experience of its authors (developers) who have spent a lot of time and/or money to gain that experience. If it was free, then an animal or an inanimate object could've written it, as long as a human was required to write it and that human has spend time or money or energy to create that output then it is not technically \"free\".\n\nOf course sharing your knowledge and experience for free is a great thing, and that's how humanity can become better and reach new levels, and it's something that religions encourage for that reason. But doing so isn't the \"natural thing\", it's more like a \"sacrifice\" you do for the sake of everybody else.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1209327482440291"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEl3T1RBeU5qa3dOVGd3TXpZANE1qb3hORGN4TmpjMU5UUTQZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEl3T1RNeU56UTRNalEwTURJNU1Ub3hORGN4TnpBMk1UTXgZD"}}}}
