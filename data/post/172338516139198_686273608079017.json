So, I'll post it here if anyone can help:\n\nI have an application where the user is building conditional expressions to do data manipulation.\nRight now, the user has to write these conditions using a text editor. We want to switch to using a GUI where it's easier for the user to not mess up.\nI'm trying to not build the GUI component myself, as this will take a lot of time. I was looking for a free open source component in either .NET, Python or JavaScript. For Desktop or web. It's an internal tool, so we don't have a budget for it, and we can build it in any language we know.\nThe expression is not a regular expression. It's a custom language that only works for a 3rd party application.\nWe're looking to be able to configure this component to explain the language's syntax/grammer.\nIf no tool is available, any recommendation on how to approach this, or examples for non-free, non-open source tools/components are very appreciated.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-01-17T00:09:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"686434944729550","from":{"id":"544815169","name":"Mohamed Meligy"},"message":"I have upvoted the question (the comments are ridiculous, since when did StackExchange stop being a good place for product/tool suggestions, I was like \"give me a break\").","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-01-17T11:16:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"686435144729530","from":{"id":"544815169","name":"Mohamed Meligy"},"message":"Unless it's a duplicate of course and the other question answer works for you too.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-01-17T11:17:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"686435734729471","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"Is it an internal or an external dsl?","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-01-17T11:19:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"686437358062642","from":{"id":"626766465","name":"Professor Mina"},"message":"You refer to a custom language so you're going to do a lot of customization to enforce your own keywords and rules also you could need to do some coding on the interface as well ...
