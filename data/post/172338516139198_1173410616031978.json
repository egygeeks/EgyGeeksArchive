At first I thought, the hardware was at fault, but then I grepped through the code base and found other instance of doing TCP without a problem. The socket calls where all protected by semaphores, a total waste for system calls but if it makes the original programmer feel safer, why not?\n\nTurns out, the other module where TCP worked, among the dozens of includes, included a header defining macros that shadowed the socket syscalls, and instead did all the TCP/IP processing in userspace and finally stuffed the frames into a kernel-side message queue, which just blew them out the NIC.\n\nI stil don't know why (I guess \"well, it was working, so when we switched to Linux we just ported our old stack as well\"), but I have trust issues ever since.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1173557526017287"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUzTXpVMU56VXlOakF4TnpJNE56b3hORFkzTkRVM016RXoZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUzTXpVMU56VXlOakF4TnpJNE56b3hORFkzTkRVM016RXoZD"}}}}
