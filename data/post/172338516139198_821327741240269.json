I guess the game maybe has auto discovery for nearby opponents around you like an alarm or something like in the video maybe by using gps and 3g, but in this case is gonna really kill your phone battery and also I may try this game for one or two. but playing this all times ? c'mon ClashOfClans still best game for mobiles :P","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-10-01T17:46:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"822180947821615","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din"},"message":"You don't need face recognition at all.
