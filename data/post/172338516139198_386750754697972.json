It allows easy recovery of various kind of passwords by sniffing the network, cracking encrypted passwords using Dictionary, Brute-Force and Cryptanalysis attacks, recording VoIP conversations, decoding scrambled passwords, recovering wireless network keys, revealing password boxes, uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols. The program does not exploit any software vulnerabilities or bugs that could not be fixed with little effort. It covers some security aspects/weakness present in protocol's standards, authentication methods and caching mechanisms; its main purpose is the simplified recovery of passwords and credentials from various sources, however it also ships some \"non standard\" utilities for Microsoft Windows users.","story":"Mohamed Alaa El Din shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"1252478278163674","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}],"48":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":48,"length":14}]},"link":"http://www.oxid.it/cain.html","name":"oxid.it - Cain & Abel","caption":"oxid.it","description":"oxid.it web site","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/386750754697972"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/386750754697972"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2012-04-20T14:56:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-04-20T14:56:16+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false}
