When I write atrocious CPP to generate code for me, I call that hacking. If I attach a Lua repl to a game so I can automate something, hacking too. If I can gain access to something via a sql injection into a searchbar, also hacking.\nI visited a hackerspace some months ago, where they hacked a 30 year old weaving machine and removed the mechanical-copy-template part and instead made it controllable from a PC. Then they bought another weaving machine and combined them to print a 3D patterned scarf.\n\nBottom line: If you (ab)use something to fit your need, you are hacking it.

The people you call hackers aren't creatively modifying anything, they are using prewritten utilities made for that specific purpose.
