The static typing is not a big deal, you can make a TypeScript interface to mock your JQuery plugin functions, but you cannot really sure that calling this function inside your component logic will give you a desired result specially if the DOM is not ready yet, so might be going to use some workarounds like setTimeout to insure that the element is present in the DOM.\nAs i see it's really not recommended to depend on JQuery but if you have to so no problem at all deal with it and suffer in silence.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1413181498721554"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF4TXpFNE1UUTVPRGN5TVRVMU5Eb3hORGc0T1RrME5EWTAZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF4TXpFNE1UUTVPRGN5TVRVMU5Eb3hORGc0T1RrME5EWTAZD"}}}}
