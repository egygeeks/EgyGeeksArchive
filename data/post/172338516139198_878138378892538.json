An example, if you want to use a specific ORM, I would create a scenario for CRUD operations on a simple ERD and a more complex one with multiple relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M), develop the POC all the way up to the UI, just for this small example and validate your Architeure in terms of development time, features and quality, you can then reuse the UI and change the ORM to try the other ORM in the same scenario. Your dev team can test the code and get a feel of how it feels to develop under the framework.
