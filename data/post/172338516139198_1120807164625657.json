Anyone with javascript knowledge would surely help. Question is:\nHow to use a text input in a HTML textbox as a variable/input for a javascript function.\n\nI have in HTML\n<input name=\"textbox1\" id=\"url\" type=\"text\" />\n<input name=\"buttonExecute\" onclick=\"testAPI()\" type=\"button\" value=\"Execute\" />\n\nNotice the testAPI()? That is the function. And it looks like that\n\nScript is:\n  function testAPI() {\n\nFB.api(\"http://graph.facebook.com/?id=HAVE HERE THE TEXT COMING FROM HTML TEXT BOx\",\n      function(response) {\n       console.log(response);\n          alert('# of fb comments: ' + response.share.comment_count);\n    alert('# of fb Shares: ' + response.share.share_count);\n      }\n    );\n\n  }\n\nI have that question about Facebook API over Stackoverflow, no one answered me yet! For a reason, a guy as well down rated. Would appreciate if someone can help or have a clue about that.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36511960/passing-html-text-input-to-facebook-api-javascript-call","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1120807164625657"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1120807164625657"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-04-09T18:24:11+0000","updated_time":"2016-04-10T03:29:48+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1142904185832197","name":"Mosaab Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTE0MjkwNDE4NTgzMjE5NwZDZD","after":"MTE0MjkwNDE4NTgzMjE5NwZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-04-09T18:26:47+0000","from":{"name":"Fady Taher","id":"10158289564115263"},"message":"don't know much about the api, but try doing the same using \nhttps://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1120808491292191"},{"created_time":"2016-04-09T18:35:34+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Said","id":"10158340042205183"},"message":"The code snippet doesn't do anything in particular, and I have to say that if I really understood what you are trying to do, then you are doing it wrong","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1120814501291590"},{"created_time":"2016-04-09T18:41:03+0000","from":{"name":"Amir Abou Eesa","id":"1353018234756623"},"message":"The second part is highly a cashing problem , try to clean ue FF CASH","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1120816457958061"},{"created_time":"2016-04-09T19:49:30+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Eldosoukey","id":"10154754915997535"},"message":"Check the JavaScript code here\n\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.5/url/\n\nAnd try to do as the provided sample does","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1120844034621970"},{"created_time":"2016-04-09T22:30:44+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Eldishnawy","id":"10154966737859462"},"message":"I updated the question here, so please someone have a look and give me a guidance","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1120901567949550"},{"created_time":"2016-04-09T22:37:24+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Hassan","id":"10155190776529497"},"message":"The question is very simple and I'm amazed there has been this many answers without actually answering it.

It took me a while to decide if your problem is that the facebook function using the input keeps using the first entered value, or if there are other problems\n\n- In the code, you call `testAPI()` twice, once with the input value, once without it. In both ways it doesn't seem that the function uses the value at all\n\nIf your problem was the value passed not updating:\n\nYou need a simple example, that shows the value logged clearly showing it's changed before the facebook call. And doesn't have anything more than that.\n\nFinally, remember everyone (not directed for the original poster specifically) that nobody owes you anything.
