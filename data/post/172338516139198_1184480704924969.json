You can just search with \".me domain meaning\" to find that Google gives you as the best answer \" it's a ccTLD to Montenegro\"\nI recommend going with the .com with another domain name or at least choosing another global TLD.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1184920824880957"},{"created_time":"2016-07-19T11:56:42+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Hisham","id":"1233723183402172"},"message":"Technically there is absolutely no difference which domain extension you wanna use for SEO.
