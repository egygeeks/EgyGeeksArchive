The most famous ones are (Theano, caffe, tensorflow , torch).\n\nPersonally i have used the first 3, Theano and Tensorflow are very easy to install (use python pip installer), Caffe is quite more difficult you will need to build it yourself, certainly it can be done on Windows using CMake but you might face few dependencies issues.\n\nSaying that Caffe is designed specifically for computer vision,  so i believe it has better and faster algorithms for CNN. I would recommend for you to try theano first, it is very easy to install and use and it has  more tutorials than any other library.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1141191792587194"},{"created_time":"2016-05-10T23:22:00+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Gamal","id":"1809200236011686"},"message":"you can use neuroph java framework","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1141217259251314"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUwTVRFNE9UUTNPVEkxTkRBNU1qb3hORFl5T1RFM09EWXcZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUwTVRJeE56STFPVEkxTVRNeE5Eb3hORFl5T1RJeU5USXcZD"}}}}
