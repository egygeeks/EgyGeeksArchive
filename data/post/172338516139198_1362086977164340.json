So i can make use of the keyboard functionality in android with a different look. \nAm i thinking right or should i just create it as a part of the layout with the regular layout components.\nI did some work with making a native custom keyboard and i changed the look but i could not get it to work when some edittext has focus. The user still have to go and choose it from settings inputmethod. I need to be able programmatically to make my keyboard the default input method. \nI just want to know what is the best way to do this build a custom keyboard or just make it in the layout.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1362086977164340"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1362086977164340"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-01-22T16:24:33+0000","updated_time":"2017-01-22T16:24:33+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1299385830145780","name":"Ahmed Alaa Mohamed"},{"id":"1364997500240454","name":"Mohamed AbuIssa"},{"id":"10154539889874091","name":"Muhammad Salah El-Okda"},{"id":"1593699700644210","name":"Yomna Gad"},{"id":"10154264953431700","name":"Ahmed Shawky Ibrahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTI5OTM4NTgzMDE0NTc4MAZDZD","after":"MTAxNTQyNjQ5NTM0MzE3MDAZD"}}}}
