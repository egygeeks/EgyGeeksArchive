Is there are a way to make the Server do the javascript processing and show the results in the browser, so the browser would be lighter ?\n\nI have googled a lot but it seem no simple solution for this.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/980832115289830"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/980832115289830"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-07-28T16:27:54+0000","updated_time":"2015-07-28T18:31:00+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-07-28T16:46:02+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Kamal","id":"10203100096301505"},"message":"What about a nodejs webservice ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"980837925289249"},{"created_time":"2015-07-28T16:56:51+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Sadek","id":"10154571159919542"},"message":"I thought about that, but couldn't find a way to have the script running on nodejs while showing the gui visualization in the browser, if you know of a tutorial or something similar, it would be great.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"980841705288871"},{"created_time":"2015-07-28T16:58:43+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Kamal","id":"10203100096301505"},"message":"I think that you will try to find a way to generate the html on the server by code and then you will just render this HTML.
