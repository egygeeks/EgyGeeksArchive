You can find tutorials here at their website. http://www.nme.io/developer/tutorials/\n2. You need to know the basics of Game Programming, so try to read any textbook that talks about game loops, finite state machines, basic AI..etc. \n3. The library itself will just give you ways to load graphics, get key handlers, play sound,..etc. You then need to load sprite animations, write some physics using another library like Box2D.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"567447416628304"},{"created_time":"2013-05-18T20:54:42+0000","from":{"name":"Ashraf Hesham","id":"1206525992793921"},"message":"good my problem is the website of nme itself, they don't have a documentation and i found it hard to start, instead of the documentation i am searching for good tutorials and the tutorials on their site are so weak :/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"567447979961581"},{"created_time":"2013-05-18T20:58:41+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Saleh","id":"10158326787715574"},"message":"You do not need any other tutorials to start with. They have all the information in their website to write a full game. First try to load a bitmap, then read their tutorials about key handlers, play sound. From that point you can write a Pong game so easily. Just add some basic vector reflections and that's all.
