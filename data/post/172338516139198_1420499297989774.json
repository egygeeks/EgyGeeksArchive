Carefully choose a few companies that you know well and aware that they are sponsoring international candidates and have no language requirements and focus on those. Carefully write a specific cover letter for each one. Look for someone to refer you or even search for a recruiter on linkedin and ping them. Of course do that after working on your CV and linkedin profile and Rabena yewfa2 ;)","can_remove":false,"like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"id":"1421102334596137"},{"created_time":"2017-03-15T11:11:13+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed Hassan","id":"1567195056628221"},"message":"this is link of my CV , i am happy to know your opinion https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3TrUbovVLbgZzc2emdmUmFnZGs/view?usp=sharing","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1421116451261392"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF5TURVd016ZA3hNVE15TWpZAMU5qb3hORGc1TlRFMU5qRXcZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF5TVRFeE5qUTFNVEkyTVRNNU1qb3hORGc1TlRjMk1qZA3cZD"}}}}
