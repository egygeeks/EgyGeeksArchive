Each copy is divided into segments of equal length. The client is smart and chooses the qualities of each segment during the streaming session based on different objectives. \n\nThe major vendor-free standardization effort is DASH. It simply defines a file (it defines many things as well) called media presentation descriptor (MPD) that lists the available segments and their qualities. The file in addition to the video copies are stored in HTTP server. The client fetches this file at the beginning and decides during the streaming session what quality to fetch. \n\nThere are many JS clients that adopt DASH:\n- dash.js (DASH-IF): the reference client implementation from DASH industry forum\n- video.js: if you use videojs, you should use this plugin with it (https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-dash)\n- shaka player (google): https://github.com/google/shaka-player\n\nYou'll notice that all these libraries request an MPD file, not a video. In your case, your task is to:\n- encode the original video into multiple copies with different qualities (SD, HD, etc...)\n- segment each copy\n- generate the MPD file that lists the segments locations and their qualities\n- use one of the previous libraries with the URL of generated MPD.\n\nYou can use ffmpeg for encoding, and Bento (https://www.bento4.com/developers/dash/) for segmenting videos and generating the MPD.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1137125709660469"},{"created_time":"2016-05-04T13:34:27+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed A.
