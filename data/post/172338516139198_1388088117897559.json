I've tried to make frame processing then detect the output pics but i can't make it work.\nSo is there any way that i can link mobile vision with my camera instance for the sack of frame processing to detect faces with it? you can see what i've done so far in here: https://github.com/etman55/FaceDetectionSampleApp","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1388088117897559"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1388088117897559"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-02-14T14:04:51+0000","updated_time":"2017-02-15T05:22:23+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-02-14T22:46:10+0000","from":{"name":"Hisham Salah","id":"885552844918437"},"message":"Have you checked OpenCV?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1388456491194055"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE00T0RRMU5qUTVNVEU1TkRBMU5Ub3hORGczTVRFeU16Y3gZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE00T0RRMU5qUTVNVEU1TkRBMU5Ub3hORGczTVRFeU16Y3gZD"}}}}
