But I'm just wondering if the SSH tunnel by itself is just sufficient to bypass DPI? I've always thought that the SSH Tunnel is some sort of a *secure* channel as all the packets between the two hosts are encrypted by default,  in which case is a VPN just an overhead (given how stupid connections in Egypt are already :D)  or is it still absolutely required? ...
