Congratulations, you just failed the Internet. You yourself could use some spell checking, a bit of grammar and a little less of conspiracy theories.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that political correctness does not equate bad grammar. If anything, it indicates a certain level of social discipline so I applaud Tarek for that. \n\nTarek Amr It's not a geeks thing, it's a commonly debated topic in English and there are no right answers to it.\nThe topic is gender-neutral pronouns in your specific case if you're interested in searching for it and gender-neutral English for the broader topic. For the language enthusiasts out there, you can dive even deeper by reading about grammatical gender.\n\nThe usage of she as a gender-specific pronoun is not grammatically incorrect.\n\nIt's an old inherited issue with English, displeasure for the usage of a male oriented pronoun has been expressed (both socially and legally) a lot in the past 20+ years enough for some linguists to call for the introduction of gender-neutral pronouns, but for what it's worth you could always use the singular 'they'.\nThat's common and it has been a consistent practice in English for decades.\n\nWhen in doubt, use what you feel more comfortable with. English literature is littered with gender-specific and gender-neutral grammatical structures. Some authors even alternate the pronoun gender by paragraphs.\n\nHope that cleared any confusion you had and apologies Mohamed if my tone sounded condescending, if it did then it probably was and that's the Internet.

You know when on sitcoms they get 2 women marrying as lesbians, and the ex-husband of one of them is there at the wedding as \"support\" (e.g. friends) political correctness. When they talk that there is no diffrence between male and female and  they say men should stay at home and women work, political correctness. What bothers me about it is that it has gone so far as to change the classical grammer of a language. I found myself writing \"s/he\" all the time, to prove that I am not a \"mysogynst\" (another politically correct word). In the end, I found I have nothing to prove and neither do you.

Once more you've displayed an enormous amount of misplaced ego, still failed to present a single credible reference stating that using \"she\" is grammatically incorrect and generally just made a fool out of yourself.\n\nClassical grammar? You surely must know that languages tend to evolve. Not to mention the fact that English never had a claim on a specific gender-specific pronoun being more correct than others or preferred for that matter.\n\nAt the very least, spare yourself any further embarrassment and for the love of god, correct \"grammer\".
