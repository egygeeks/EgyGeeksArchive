Is there a reason behind this unhelpful behavior?\n\nMohammed Ezzat So you're looking for suggestions about the analysis and design of software systems? What kind of software systems? Enterprise, Web, Embedded or Mobile? What industry? Banking, high frequency trading or logistics\nAre you pursing a certain requirement like concurrency or fault tolerance? Looking to support a certain feature like hot-code swapping? What are you looking for? Modularity, efficiency, extensibility, maintainability?\n\nOr are you asking about certain paradigms, AOP, OOP, FBP...etc. Most of everything I said will either be acquired via practical experience, concurrency models for instance unless you've worked in a system or with an environment that demanded such requirement, you'd hardly find it in a book detailing it.\n\nOther things would require some academic research and digging into systems that support certain requirements like hot-code swapping.\n\nOther things you'd easily pick up from a book or two, covering relative topics, the topic itself or part of the topic. \nThere's hardly a single book or academic paper out there that covers in great details enterprise patterns, enterprise architectures and design choices behind some systems. Some might address a specific philosophy or a group of ideas/patterns.\n\nOther things you'd be better off asking someone with experience, like working on a modular code base, or design patterns that have proven from someone's own personal experience to offer more extensibility.\n\nAn open ended question like, suggestions to help me analyze and design a system from idea to implementation and release is rather hard to answer. \nShare an idea and we can offer some assistance and guidance in how to take it from an idea on a piece of paper to a product release. It's a multidisciplinary question, crafting software is a bit more than system design and requirements analysis :)\n\nGood luck","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10212365276868126","length":14,"name":"Aboubakr Gamal","offset":0,"type":"user"},{"id":"10209738059582902","length":14,"name":"Mohammed Ezzat","offset":122,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"805408469498863"},{"created_time":"2014-08-27T19:14:42+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed Ezzat","id":"10209738059582902"},"message":"Thank you for your effort writing th7s detailed answer, the idea about creating web application framework that can accept plugins, maybe a flexible cms or something like this","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"805411672831876"},{"created_time":"2014-08-27T19:15:22+0000","from":{"name":"Aboubakr Gamal","id":"10212365276868126"},"message":"Because,l need the answer of this question. \nI wanted to be notified.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"805411982831845"},{"created_time":"2014-08-27T19:17:06+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed Ezzat","id":"10209738059582902"},"message":"Aboubakr Gamal u can turn on the notifications for specific post without tagged ur self","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10212365276868126","length":14,"name":"Aboubakr Gamal","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"805412496165127"},{"created_time":"2014-08-27T19:18:58+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"Aboubakr Gamal","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10212365276868126","length":14,"name":"Aboubakr Gamal","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"805412942831749"},{"created_time":"2014-08-27T19:19:28+0000","from":{"name":"Aboubakr Gamal","id":"10212365276868126"},"message":"Thanks","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"805413092831734"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPREExTXpreU1USTJNVFkzTVRZAME9qRTBNRGt4TmpNeU56az0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPREExTkRFek1Ea3lPRE14TnpNME9qRTBNRGt4TmpjeE5qZAz0ZD"}}}}
