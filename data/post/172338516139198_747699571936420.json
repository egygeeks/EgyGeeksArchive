Second update added VB and the third added Ruby, which tells me one of two things if not both: \n\na) You haven't done much research on your end before you posted\nb) You have little to no idea about what you're asking about\n\nSo which is it? Also while you're at it, could you explain what do you mean by building applications visually?\n\nDo you mean code builds (Ruby doesn't exactly have that notion) or do you mean constructing applications using visual tools like GUI builder and the like, or are you just looking for a point & click software that abstracts you away from the terminal.\n\nA quick google search for VS alternatives can yield a lot of fruitful results and since I presume you're already familiar with VS being an IDE, a little google search for Ruby IDE will yet again, yield a lot of fruitful results.\n\nGood luck.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"747772041929173"},{"created_time":"2014-05-17T00:29:41+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Adel","id":"10155949666619129"},"message":"I edit post because no one answer me, so i became more specific ... , Visual developing means mainly building GUI rather than playing with code and getting the debugger reports , with visual developing tools coder can play with codes and link them to standard shell elements ...
