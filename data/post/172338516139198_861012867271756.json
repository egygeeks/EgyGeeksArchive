I believe that the performance will drop in concurrent read/writes ..\n\nFor example, the tested GPU card would give you >200 GB/sec memory bandwidth, however, the achieved bandwidth is about 2 GB/sec which is 100X slower! \nWhen we write code that reads/writes to RAM, we expect a transfer rate of 5-10 GB/s (more or less based on the used RAM), one simply wouldn't provision for this large decrease in the transfer rate resulted from poor implementation of this library, especially with the comparison of RAM price vs GPU price. \nHowever, I think this is a good effort, and better implementation(s) will make it an interesting library to use or investigate. Also, it will be interesting to implement this in distributed setups.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"861426853897024"},{"created_time":"2014-12-15T15:49:01+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Al-Amir","id":"10155179919799180"},"message":"I like it that you have been through the code, but it says right there in the intro that it is for fun and not intended for production environments :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"861604697212573"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPRFl4TURnd01qVTNNalkxTURFM09qRTBNVGcxT1RFMk56QT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPRFl4TmpBME5qazNNakV5TlRjek9qRTBNVGcyTlRnMU5ERT0ZD"}}}}
