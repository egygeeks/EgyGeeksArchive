The weird thing is that we cannot reach them over any encrypted port (ssh, VPN, etc) even on different non-standard port numbers.\nWe got this response from a provider.\nMoreover, when we tried to access them from outside Egypt everything worked fine.\nWhen we troubleshoot the thing we find out that the connection is established but certificate negotiation fails. It seems out a####le government is installing something that messes up certificates on the way.\nDoes anyone know if this is a temporary situation or if they will incrementally cut-off services ?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1200547623318277"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1200547623318277"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-08-10T15:41:35+0000","updated_time":"2016-08-11T07:03:03+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154827860545239","name":"Ahmed Mekkawy"},{"id":"1741131606198885","name":"Mohamed Eshra"},{"id":"10211811206896077","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTQ4Mjc4NjA1NDUyMzkZD","after":"MTAyMTE4MTEyMDY4OTYwNzcZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-08-10T15:50:53+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"What does our hardworking, patriotic, government have to do with that?
