A Library is something that is called by your application and it does NOT run independently. With well designed frameworks and AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), you can make your application framework independent. BUT, this requires proper design with accurately documented Pointcuts. A good framework will work with POCO/POJO Objects and the framework does it's magic through xml or runtime configuration or AOP. I would encourage you all to look at Spring as a great example of that, and I believe that Java is more advanced that .NET in this aspect, although it would not be impossible to have a framework in .NET (.NET framework :) ) that can do similar functionality.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1038935102812864"},{"created_time":"2015-11-30T22:41:46+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"Also, Functional programming vs OO.
