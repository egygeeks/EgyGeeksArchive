So that's not a syntax error. \n\nIt just became a good a very well & established best practice to use them because of how the runtime will add semi colons for you (Google JavaScript automatic semi colon insertion or ASI) which can lead to subtle errors if you don't know how it works. \n\nTo catch these kind of errors use ESLint in your editor of choice. \n\nESLint can work as you want, so if you want to keep writing with semi-colons then it can catch if you miss any & also if you want to write without semi-colons it can tell you when this might break. \n\n\nFor example this is an opinionated ESLint config that works without semi-colons. \n\nhttp://standardjs.com\n\nAnd this another one that works with semi-colons\n\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1339096279463410"},{"created_time":"2016-12-27T22:14:00+0000","from":{"name":"Hosam G.
