I'm working on my graduation project unfortunately it's on 3D Simulation & modeling for a railway trains interruptions.\nMy Question is anyone can help which is Better Maya Autodesk or Blender to work with if am gonna need to use some Codes in C#, or Should i code with prolog for the train reactions ? & 1st of all, which 1st ?\nIt's the 2nd time for me that Youtube & Google failed to help ..","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/903630513009991"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/903630513009991"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-03-03T13:04:31+0000","updated_time":"2015-03-04T20:16:05+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1692622017433057","name":"Mohammed Khalaf"},{"id":"10212595711546911","name":"Nouran Sami"},{"id":"10207929013055153","name":"NaDa YaSser"},{"id":"1383502638381750","name":"Ahmed Alaa Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTY5MjYyMjAxNzQzMzA1NwZDZD","after":"MTM4MzUwMjYzODM4MTc1MAZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-03-03T17:11:33+0000","from":{"name":"Moutaz Shams","id":"1647326241951498"},"message":"ماعنديش خبرة في مشاريع من النوعية دي تحديدا، ربما يكون فيه برامج مباشرة بتسهّل المحاكاة، إنما لو بيئة ثلاثية الأبعاد بشكل عام هأفكر استخدم Unity لأنه بيدعم سي-شارب، وبيشتغل على أنظمة كتير ومن ضمنها الويب، وسهل وله مصادر تعليم كتير. بالنسبة للـ modeling فالبرامج المذكورة امكانياتهم متشابهة وكلهم بيعرفوا يعملوا export لبعضهم ولأشهر أنواع الملفات ولهم مصادر كتير والخ ولذلك أحسن اختيار هو البرنامج اللي حد في الفريق يعرفه أكتر","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"903720556334320"},{"created_time":"2015-03-04T18:48:00+0000","from":{"name":"Hassan Aly Selim","id":"10155071713202292"},"message":"I don't fully understand what you're trying to do, but Unity is a great game engine (that supports C#) and could be suitable for 3D Simulations depending on what you want to do and what aspect of the simulation you want to focus on.\nMaybe you should focus first on modeling the train movement and interruptions first then think about the 3D rendering later as there are many options for that.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"904247432948299"},{"created_time":"2015-03-04T19:26:33+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Ahmed Sadek Mohammed Tawfeek","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154215525191922","length":28,"name":"Ahmed Sadek Mohamed Tawfik","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"904262186280157"},{"created_time":"2015-03-04T19:53:09+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Sadek Mohamed Tawfik","id":"10154215525191922"},"message":"hello .. as Hassan said you should focus on the train movement mathematical model .. that can be implemented later in any language .. by the way blender and Maya are tools for creating  3D modes that 3D engines should try to load it and put it on the environment .. personally I don't have experience with 3D engines .. but there are many engines out there .. I may suggest the famous MonoGame engine.  but you actually need to focus on the mathematical model.  my advice is to start simply with a 2D plan .. and treat the train as a moving point on the 2D .. then add the third dimension later.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10155071713202292","length":6,"name":"Hassan Aly Selim","offset":12,"type":"user"},{"id":"361877677240404","length":8,"name":"MonoGame","offset":385,"type":"page"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"904270716279304"},{"created_time":"2015-03-04T19:56:52+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Sadek Mohamed Tawfik","id":"10154215525191922"},"message":"for a concise review from my side .. begin with vector analysis dot and cross products ..  remember always that the cross product gives you a vector normal to the plan of the two vectors .. \nthen review the concept of the parametric functions \nfinally it seems you will need to draw the train path with Bezier Curves .. only use a cubic bezier curve functions ..
