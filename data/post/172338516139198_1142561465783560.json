I personally use Semantic UI because it fits my needs, also I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap's grid. If you need to use a framework for a big project, you can use Bootstrap since it's easier than other frameworks. If you wanna use a grid only, you can use a grid like Skeleton. If you want a lightweight framework you can use Semantic UI or UIkit.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1142569395782767"},{"created_time":"2016-05-13T07:08:46+0000","from":{"name":"George Kastour","id":"10212602524963785"},"message":"Thanks Ahmed!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1142570745782632"},{"created_time":"2016-05-13T08:27:41+0000","from":{"name":"Alhasan A.
