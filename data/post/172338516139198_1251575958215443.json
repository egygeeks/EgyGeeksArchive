The language itself doesn't really matter if you'll end up using a framework anyway so the comparison should be between frameworks not languages. I'm biased towards Python so I'll tell you to use python/Django for the blah blah blah blah reasons, another member of the group is a \"code artisan :P\" who likes Ruby will give you a different set of reasons to go for RoR. That's all crap IMHO, What you should do is layout a basic system architecture based on your business goals and then match this system to the most appropriate environment, you might surprise yourself at the end and use a completely different approach other than both.","can_remove":false,"like_count":17,"user_likes":false,"id":"1251583674881338"},{"created_time":"2016-10-07T13:33:55+0000","from":{"name":"Said Bakr","id":"10154979109648745"},"message":"عندي اعتقاد موش عارف صح ولا غلط. البايثون على المدى الطويل أفضل لخبرات ومهارات المطور اللي هيشتغل بيه.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1251597398213299"},{"created_time":"2016-10-07T14:07:17+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"Whichever one you feel better working with.
