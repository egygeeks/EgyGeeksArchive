I have some tips though:\n1- do you have to run experiments or just writing? In the second case, you can use writelatex or the like. \n2- can't your professor support you? Do you consider student loans as well? To me, this is an exceptional case, and the university/professor should consider helping you.\n3- don't you have a computer in your lab? Or in the library? \nHope you figure this out soon. Good luck.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"951804634859245"},{"created_time":"2015-06-01T05:30:42+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Osman","id":"10155346413617448"},"message":"1- Since it is an interaction paper, a lot of experiments and evaluation needs to be done on the system. \n2- the professor is only a (paper) supervisor, and I am currently in contact with the university and the master program to figure if they can help me\n3- Yes, but the university (outside Paris) is 2 hours away from where I live, I only go there to follow up with the professor, and it will be a waste of time to go there everyday.
