IE is on the top of this list. I abandoned it since IE 6, and used it only for UI testing or stupid websites which refuse to work on other browsers\n\n1. Security sucks\n2. Very weak support for standards: no support for rounded corners till IE9, transparent PNG till IE7 (not sure which version) & many others\n3. Slow compared to other browsers\n4. The latest browser to include tabs\n5. Very few extensions compared to other browsers, and most are bloody spyware\n6. The developer toolbar sucks compared to Firebug or Developer tools in Chrome\n\nI'm not the only one who spent countless hours fixing stuff to work on IE","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2013-05-16T18:22:02+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"566603280046051","from":{"id":"1246823411","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},"message":"Great post, keep it up :)","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2013-05-16T21:05:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY2NjAzMjgwMDQ2MDUx","before":"NTY2NTIzMTYzMzg3Mzk2"}}}}
