AAA titles cost millions of dollars in production, marketing and distribution. \nGame studios and game publishers need to cater to markets that are willing to buy their games and for long the Linux user base has been (wrongly) perceived as non-gamers.\n\nThere has also been a lot of debates with regards to commercial software licenses on Linux, lots of wrong perceptions about the spirit behind the OSS movement and the lack of support from hardware vendors and chip manufacturers.\nCompanies like Nvidia only recently started playing nice with distro vendors.","can_remove":false,"like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"id":"765838320122545"},{"created_time":"2014-06-16T23:18:38+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"Linux is also known to work extremely well on low-end machines, so the consensus amongst industry experts is, if you're on Linux, you're likely there because your work demands it, your hardware is not too powerful and you're not too keen on paying for software.\n\nLinux also plays well with others, you can dual boot Linux and Windows, Linux and OSX which is something Windows and OSX aren't too nice about.\n\nSo when you look at the consumer base, you'll find more end users on Windows and Mac, more power users on Linux/Unix and dual booting isn't rocket science.
