It's within your responsibilities to carry out removals and permanent bans for members that display a potential threat to the community's fabric. No need to open it for debate, each of the admin members is selected carefully to fit a specific criteria, in layman's terms a good admin is a good judge of character, fair and not trigger hungry.\n\nPeople that get added and within a few minutes post an ad, I've banned and will continue to ban many of those as they come along. \nWarnings are mostly subliminal, should come in a corrective, constructive form. Most people get the gist and back-off from an unwanted behaviour.\n\nVery rare cases should require an explicitly clear ban warning, like the case of this lame series of posts by a group of wanna-be developers building a clone of bufferapp. They generated a lot of friction enough to force a couple of admins and myself to explicitly give out warnings. The warnings went into effect as well, sad as it sounds but necessary.\n\nThe dude that keeps posting about wordpress, displaying little to no will for learning, self-improving and contributing something worth the community's time shouldn't get banned, he got the gist after a few harsh but constructive comments and a couple of post deletions.\n\nOther cases that require clear corrective actions, banning being the last on the list are policy violations. Ads are prohibited, a clear spam behaviour as mentioned above demands a ban.\n\nOther cases (most of them) of an ad being posted don't require a ban until the offender has repeated that action multiple times. Other cases require patience, like job posts. A new system was put in place, stated in the policy yet people still post here.\nA few corrective comments and now any new job ad is removed immediately without warning or instructions.\n\nAnother case, that walked the gray line with me was automated posts. I've monitored someone post from an app, on a regular schedule 4 posts on two groups without regard to the nature of the post and its relevance to this group and it was a violation of policy. He didn't get a ban, a clear explicit warning was given and the problem was resolved.\n\n All in all, I see little reason behind this post and this discussion. You've been entrusted with a responsibility because you're fit to carry it through. Do what you need to do to keep the community healthy but exercise self control, patience and due diligence.\n\nGood luck.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"803973706309006"},{"created_time":"2014-08-25T08:06:59+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"I've raised this point before and I'll raise it again, due diligence is required from the administrative team on who joins and who doesn't.

The filtering efforts that have and will continue to take place, are to qualify the types of \"how tos\". In other words, if you're looking for how to track your wordpress analytics with a plugin and asking if anyone knows a plugin then you're at the wrong place.\n\nI'd rather see someone asking about a technical detail in writing a wordpress plugin, with another answering, sharing their experience from writing their own wordpress plugins.\n\nIf it exists on Google, it doesn't belong here. It's a blanket statement, but in a gist it's quite true. If I can find it on Google, you can.
