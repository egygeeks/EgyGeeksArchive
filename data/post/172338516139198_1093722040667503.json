After looking around for away I found that services like Hola VPN does this, and it's for free, BUT it's not programmable (Doesn't have an API or something I can talk to programmatically :( ).\n\nMy question: is there away through which I can programmatically change the machine's (it's a Windows Server BTW) proxy setup depending on service or a tool like Hola ? Or really any other way.  \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPS: The one solution I could come up with was to use the Hola Chrome extension and use NodeJS to control the mouse and trigger the change, but we all know that this is stupid and unreliable (but I tried it and it's working :) ). If you are wondering about the mouse being controlled by code and not by the user, know that this software will be running on a remote Windows/Linux server, and wont be accessed that much.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1093722040667503"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1093722040667503"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-03-08T19:11:01+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-09T19:38:42+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10206729253628431","name":"Deyaa Muhamed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMDY3MjkyNTM2Mjg0MzEZD","after":"MTAyMDY3MjkyNTM2Mjg0MzEZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-03-08T20:41:17+0000","from":{"name":"Amir Abou Eesa","id":"1353018234756623"},"message":"Why u dont just configure proxy from a pre defined list","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1093769553996085"},{"created_time":"2016-03-09T19:38:40+0000","from":{"name":"Hassan Aly Selim","id":"10155071713202292"},"message":"To change proxy settings for IE you can set the following Registry Keys:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\nProxyEnable (0 or 1)\nProxyServer (string containing ip:port)\nYou can automate their change using batch scripts, powershell scripts, or C# :)\n\nFor firefox you'll probably have to change a SQLite file, and for chrome it'll probably be a json file","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1094359807270393"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEE1TXpjMk9UVTFNems1TmpBNE5Ub3hORFUzTkRZANU5qYzMZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEE1TkRNMU9UZA3dOekkzTURNNU16b3hORFUzTlRVeU16SXgZD"}}}}
