Basically I need 1-2TB of storge space with the most important factor having an FTP or FTP-like access to upload and download (Web based upload sucks, and I don't want to auto sync files because this defeats the whole point of backup).\n\nAll for something like $10/month... I have been searching for a day and none of the mainstream solutions (GDrive, OneDrive, etc.) fits, neither I found a low-end VPS with such disk space... maybe you can enlighten me with your experience?\n\nThanks for your help!","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1382181875154850"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1382181875154850"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-02-08T06:46:25+0000","updated_time":"2017-02-08T18:12:31+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10155099548114764","name":"Mahmoud Tantawy"},{"id":"10154884040390170","name":"Mohammed El Sayed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTUwOTk1NDgxMTQ3NjQZD","after":"MTAxNTQ4ODQwNDAzOTAxNzAZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-02-08T06:48:52+0000","from":{"name":"Abdelrhman Fahmy","id":"1407246199327759"},"message":"Check hetzner\nhttps://www.hetzner.de/hosting/produktmatrix/storagebox-produktmatrix","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382182765154761"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T06:57:37+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmad Hisham","id":"10158274819655058"},"message":"Try Amazon S3, it doesn't support FTP (as I recall), but it has a comprehensive command line client that you can use as you want.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382186755154362"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T07:14:34+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Refaat","id":"10158355315435635"},"message":"Nearline.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#nearline","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382199135153124"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T07:20:56+0000","from":{"name":"Mootaz Dinana","id":"10154839781925306"},"message":"So do you use any form of encryption for your files once they're on the server?","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382201615152876"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T08:38:50+0000","from":{"name":"Eslam Hamouda","id":"10210277573008432"},"message":"https://www.backblaze.com is your friend with unlimited *encrypted* storage at 5$/month only, I'm using it personally and highly recommend it.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382238311815873"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T08:45:13+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Negm","id":"10212131509466411"},"message":"S3 seems a fit for your needs, you might encrypt it at rest with kms, use a lambda function for uploads and downloads.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382241715148866"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T09:14:59+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Ibrahim Amer","id":"10210928061291486"},"message":"why you didn't think of creating your own server?","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382256958480675"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T09:15:53+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Eltantawi","id":"10158483817395314"},"message":"This seems good with many positive reviews and fits the bill nicely https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/ Anyone using it?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382257261813978"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T09:27:07+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Omar Zaian","id":"10154907377181047"},"message":"Build ur own http://owncloud.org","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1382263168480054"},{"created_time":"2017-02-08T09:55:57+0000","from":{"name":"Hesham Amin","id":"1301687309911794"},"message":"AWS S3: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/.
