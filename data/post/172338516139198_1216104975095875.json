First time writing the password gave back a page with \"Your account/password is wrong\" and the form pointing to the original website again. That way the person thought he just wrote the password wrong first time and ignores it. I told some guys about the website, because many people playing the game in internet cafes needed help with opening a web browser and getting to the account management pages. My guys then offered help and wrote my website instead. :D\n\nHad I known about javascript or cURL and the hosts file, it could have been so much more effective. ^^","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1216194088420297"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEl4TmpFeE5qSTVPRFF5T0RBM05qb3hORGN5TXpJNU5qQTQZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEl4TmpFNU5EQTRPRFF5TURJNU56b3hORGN5TXpNM09ERTQZD"}}}}
