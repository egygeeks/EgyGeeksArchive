They have a timeline with projects that are asked form you, they also give you recommended classes to attend in order to finish the project, even though I already worked with fron end technologies I watched even the introductory classes about stuff I already know, because they have awesome developers that already have jobs as front end developer and who would give you a lot of advices on how you should write your code and how to start with a task, and all these small things that make a difference in the code you write.\n\nThey let you use github extensively to have all your projects there so recruiters can take a look when/if you apply for a job and see that you indeed know what you're talking abotu and actually worked with it. \n\nProjects cover, HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTML5 Canvas, Object Oriented Javascript, Website optimization, using APIs like maps, and Javascript testing. \n\nYou get feedback for every project you submit. My last project included feedback about good things I've done, and feedback on small things I should fix, like a missing semicolon, adding other browsers support for animation, removing an empty function that I forgot about, and some missing html closing tag. This was the thing I built, which is an online resume I customized for something they provided us with, as I am following up with Intro to Javascript course:\nhttp://rashahussein.github.io/online-resume/\n\nAnd this is the code: https://github.com/RashaHussein/online-resume","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"954723697900672"},{"created_time":"2015-06-05T22:37:25+0000","from":{"name":"Hosam G.

This project was pretty basic for me, I already had an online resume, but built it anyway, because I wanted feedback on my code structure and I am more conscious to building well organized code this way. They gave me good feedback on the modularity of my code which I never had in the online resume that I built on my own, the code was all over the place (www.rasha.me) ! I kinda also learned more about how to build your own templating system, which I never thought about. i mean I know how templating works but never thought of building my own and how would that be like.\nThey ask that you have prior experience in the topics listed, but of course if you already have extensive experience in them, then no need to take it. It's not a zero to hero program, it's to enhance your already existing skills. The main thing about it is you building the projects, and following up with the career program they have setup for you, including hangouts with udacity people. You can skip the classes if you think you know what's in there. however I didn't skip any class, i think I am a big fan of those guys! I also always have something to learn, I usually watch the classes on a 2X speed though, cause most of the info in the intro classes was stuff I know. However the classes on mobile web, responsive design, responsive images and optimization, were full of good stuff and good practices I didn't know about. \n\nThe next project is an Arcade Game. This one is supposed to be challenging. \n\nThe guy who founded udacity is the same one who founded Google X. And he wants to revolutionize education! They're adding more nanodegrees. I might consider getting into the mobile world sometime later.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"954728947900147"},{"created_time":"2015-06-05T23:25:02+0000","from":{"name":"Hosam G.
