Moving from shared hosts to VPS is a must. I got my 7$ monthly VPS (Unmanaged) from VPSDime with 6GB of Ram and 30GB SSD Space. So far, its a great experience ! i didn't expect that i'd get such specification with only 7$/month. I regret the time i waste in shared hosts.\"\n\n","story":"Maged Eladawy shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"1220459164735315","name":"Maged Eladawy","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}],"42":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":42,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQD3nhDlhpYRaIi9&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvpsdime.com%2Fimages%2Fprofile_image.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQD9Xo7QXWAKLNDU","link":"https://vpsdime.com/","name":"VPSDime - Cheap VPS Hosting","caption":"vpsdime.com","description":"Cheap High Memory and High Storage VPS Hosting","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/991718264201215"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/991718264201215"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2015-08-18T12:01:12+0000","updated_time":"2015-08-19T09:13:48+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"621823724675667","name":"Anas Rabei"},{"id":"10158476825265637","name":"Ahmed Aswani"},{"id":"10154581153441219","name":"Omar Sameh Shehata"},{"id":"10154379038212957","name":"Emad Elsaid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"NjIxODIzNzI0Njc1NjY3","after":"MTAxNTQzNzkwMzgyMTI5NTcZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-08-18T12:03:43+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"More low price providers that i don't actually hav any experience with\n\nhttps://hostus.us/openvz-vps.html\nhttp://www.servermania.com/linux-ssd-vps-specials.htm#\nhttp://waveride.at/plans\nhttps://openvz.io/","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"991718777534497"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T12:35:39+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"Why CentOS?!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"991727557533619"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T13:03:53+0000","from":{"name":"Anas Rabei","id":"621823724675667"},"message":"6GB of RAM and 30GB SSD for 7$ (y)","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"991735087532866"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T13:04:12+0000","from":{"name":"Hosny Abd Elrahman","id":"10154379766019013"},"message":"Can you tell us about your experience with the performance of the VPS.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"991735277532847"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T13:10:12+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed ElSifi","id":"1433288740024891"},"message":"Ahmed Said","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154947686536550","length":10,"name":"Ahmed Said","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"991737280865980"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T14:23:07+0000","from":{"name":"Omar Sherif","id":"10158224231920062"},"message":"your experience with your performance of the VPS Please !! daroori awe dyh","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"991758587530516"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T14:50:35+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"Mosab Ahmad no technical reasons, just got bored of deb-based distributions...!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154868571206047","length":11,"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"991768194196222"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T14:51:37+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"guys performance is awesome...here is some tests from my vps","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"991768420862866"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T14:51:59+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"Testing Upload & Download Speed","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"991768504196191"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T14:52:21+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"991768614196180"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T14:53:14+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"Testing I/O speed","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"991768774196164"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T15:09:33+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Magdy","id":"10158455015870360"},"message":"What's the output of \"iostat -cdm\" and what's the virtualization type \"OpenVZ, Xen or KVM\" ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"991772687529106"},{"created_time":"2015-08-18T15:14:17+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"Bored of debian based distros!
