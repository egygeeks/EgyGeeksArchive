Using \"Code First\" you can start right away with your model classes and proceed to other coding tasks without even having a DB. The framework then will build the DB for you in Run time. The best part however is thanks to the automated DB Data initialization support I was able to very easily write integration tests for my DAL and I was able to examine my design from the very beginning.

LLBLGen Pro is easy, well-designed & powerful but expensive (300 USD). NHibernate is free & powerful but requires sometime to work well with it. Linq2Sql is easy but generates slow queries. \n\nI had the worst experience with Entity Framework. It lacks lazy loading, which makes something like\n\n    student.Class.Teachers\n\ntakes 5 lines instead of 1. It generates large & unnecessarily complex queries, and it can take 2 minutes to generate a query of (60KB of size!!!), which takes only 2 seconds to execute in Sql Server. (This is my experience)\n\nI used to always advice against using Entity Framework, but now I suggest that you make a comparison between different ORMs & choose what suits you better. I suggest you put these into your account\n\n1.
