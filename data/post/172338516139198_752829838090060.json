Let's take a look at how the web works from a bird's eye view.\n\nYou got a web browser, let's say Firefox. You got a web server, somewhere around the world. It's hosting a website, let's call it thewebrocks.tld\n\nNow, Mr. Foobar decided he will visit thewebrocks.com, so he opened his Firefox, typed thewebrocks.tld then... he waited.\n\n.. still waiting\n\n.. he has a slow connection, nothing is showing up yet, he's still waiting\n\n.. now he thinks TEData did the deed, and cut off his Internet.\n\nAha!! Finally, the website loads.\nWhat happed was Firefox sent a \"synchronous\" request to the web server that hosts thewebrocks.tld\n\nAnd it waited for a reply, blocking everything. Showing nothing until the whole thing loads.\n\nSomeone at Microsoft in the 90s came up with a brilliant idea (this is a rare occasion in Microsoft, we're grateful) of \"asynchronous\" requests. That is, to send a request in the background and forget about it.\n\nUntil the request is complete, the website (thewebrocks.tld) and the browser are free to do anything else they want.\n\nHence the name, Ajax = Asynchronous Javascript and xml, aka making browsers suck less.\nWhat happens is, using Javascript you can send asynchronous http requests to a server and then continue whatever else you were doing.\n\nHow is this any different than angularjs, jquery, emberjs, knockout, backbonejs, spinejs? There's no relation between them.\n\nAjax is just a fancy set of technologies to make asynchronous requests less painful, it's a communication model, it's a way through which your client side code would communicate with a server.\n\nAngularjs and the likes are frameworks, a framework is a set of reusable components, libraries and functions that abstract away concepts like data binding, view templates (reusable html bits), server communication, event handling, code organization...etc. \n\nIf after reaching to this line, you still have issues understanding then you're shit outta luck.\n\nGood luck.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-05-25T13:07:44+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"752856434754067","message":"Hady, don't you think that the  browser itself tolerant enough to paint some things until the fully load of the page? \nI mean the first request.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-05-25T13:16:54+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"752857761420601","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"It most certainly does, unless you included some resource in your page's head that was blocking the flow, eventually not being able to read the body tag.

Some JS frameworks like jQuery and Angular.JS give you nicer APIs that wrap the browser one, and give you more features in general which differ by framework. \n\njQuery for example allows you to get a nicer API for communicating with DOM (HTML elements) in your JS code. Angular.JS gives you an API to handle this communication for you so rhat you don't have to write it at all (in most cases, and keep the code that talks to DOM for the rest of the cases).\n\nWhen it comes to API both jQuery and Angular.JS have features like intercepting all requests and defereed/promie (a way to chain multiple success/error handlers) , etc. Angular.JS API integrates with the rest of Angular.JS features of course if you prrfer the DOM to be handled for you to have cleaner code.\n\nGoogle \"$.ajax\" and \"$http\" for syntax differences","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-05-26T07:30:11+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"753346994705011","from":{"id":"1048647743","name":"Ahmed Tarek"},"message":"Hady Ahmed Mohamed Meligy Amr ELsaqqa Mostafa Hussein thnx all i think everything is clear for me now","message_tags":[{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10},{"id":"544815169","name":"Mohamed Meligy","type":"user","offset":11,"length":14},{"id":"565714700","name":"Amr ELsaqqa","type":"user","offset":26,"length":11},{"id":"100006020376039","name":"Mostafa Hussein","type":"user","offset":38,"length":15}],"can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-05-26T08:41:52+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzUzMzQ2OTk0NzA1MDEx","before":"NzUyODMwOTM0NzU2NjE3"}}}}
