If all you need is to extract a few good tags for each post then I would suggest that you either do some clustering, or simply calculate co-occurence (how often 2 words appear together in the same sentence/paragraph/post versus how often those words appear in general). To make things a little more useful I suggest that you exclude all stop words (like a, the, that, etc. example here http://www.textfixer.com/resources/common-english-words.txt), and if you want to get fancy, calculate tf-idf scores for each co-occurence to narrow down the really useful stuff (but now we're back in overkill territory :D ).
