This is not DevOps in the ultimate sense but it was the closest you can get in this company.\n\nThere were some Pros:\n=================\n- you look at your code very differently when you deploy it. you start thinking differently about TDD and CI and CD. \n- For some reason, developers (Windows Developers) are not big on automation, it is not baked in their nature like those of Linux background. Handling some Ops, activates this part in your brain.\n- You understand your product much better.\n- if you have influence in the Dev Dept. and you take some Ops responsibility, you get leverage in 2 departments. Which gives you more influence in the company decisions, something that you rarely get being just a developer, especially as the company grows larger.\n\nAnd some Cons:\n=============\n- To the Dev team, you become the friendly IT Guy. You get swamped fighting fire. and you get less time to code and finish your actual development tasks.\n- Some people have the culture of (if someone else knows it, I don't have to), so if you try to teach your fellow developers some Ops skills, you get lots of resistance\n- If you don't get some power over the infrastructure (decision making power) then it is just a burden.\n- Doing anything without proper education, hurts. There is a saying (Knows just enough to be dangerous), You may think you know enough, but you are actually ignorant and you don't even know what you don't know :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1041315459241495"},{"created_time":"2015-12-06T07:55:22+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Fouad","id":"10154777096910845"},"message":"That being said, I believe every developer should do some IT/Operations, and Customer Support.
