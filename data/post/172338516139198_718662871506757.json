Yes\n\nDo Arabs at large or Egyptians in specific produce commercial quality software products? Yes\n\nWhere are these people? Not anywhere within a 10 mile radius.. No for real though, once they start smelling like hot potential they're booted out of the region.\n\nAre we the best? No\n\nWhy? Many reasons most people wont like hearing but can be summed in that most are lazy and unprofessional\n\nWhy are most people lazy and unprofessional? Because most lack the incentive to become better\n\nWhy? Because like any economic market, a healthy one is determined by a few criteria one of the most critical is proper demand.\n\nWe. Do. Not. Have. Proper. Software. Demand. Believe it or not, that's really how simple the problem by definition is. The solution is an order of magnitude complicated. Maybe the subject of another post/comment.\n\nThe industry in Egypt is a bit wider than you already know. It's just not getting any better because everyday we're losing more trained experienced calibre than we're injecting into the market.\n\nIt's too soon for you to feel this level of frustration, it's understandable but not justifiable. It's not that grim, not today anyway. Maybe 5-6 years ago.\n\nMy advice is, don't worry about it now. If you have an interest in a certain segment of the industry then focus on it. Just keep in mind, the more interesting the segment is, the harder it'll be to find many others sharing the same interests here as such less work.\n\nEgyptian software market is simply dull and unentertaining. But it's there.\n\nGood luck.","message_tags":[{"id":"100000224131120","name":"Moutaz Shams","type":"user","offset":48,"length":12}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T18:27:56+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false},{"id":"718683608171350","from":{"id":"100002377283171","name":"Ahmed Abo Mazin"},"message":"thanks but there is one question \nif there is a marker and good engineers why i didn't see there volunteering work in the filled I only see English videos \nsuch as action for mouse","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T18:41:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"718683701504674","from":{"id":"100002377283171","name":"Ahmed Abo Mazin"},"message":"thanks but there is one question \nif there is a marker and good engineers why i didn't see there volunteering work in the filled I only see English videos \nsuch as action for mouse","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T18:41:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"718684201504624","from":{"id":"558270644","name":"Mahmoud Magdy"},"message":"باضافة صغيرة\nفي كل مجال في النص كم و في الغالي انت اللي يتحدد من خلال مستواك انا اعرف ناس بيتدفع فيها 5000 دولار في اليوم شغل برمجة و ناس 8000 دولار شغل شبكات في اليوم بس يا ترى انت حتوصب لمرحلة الاحتراف ده\nاعمل اللي بتحبه و سيبك من اي فتي و هري","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T18:43:59+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"718693631503681","from":{"id":"740765313","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"},"message":"Well said Hady Ahmed","message_tags":[{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmed","type":"user","offset":10,"length":10}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T19:10:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"718698961503148","from":{"id":"1101934212","name":"Si Yosri"},"message":"hey man you still in the beginning of the road ..
