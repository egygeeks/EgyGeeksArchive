So let's say time.now() returns 23:59:59.0, then 23:59:59.1 and so on until 23:59:59.9 and then 00:00:00 it will take 2 \"real-life seconds\", but it has still been perceived by the program as 1 normal, forward-moving second.\n\nWhat did I miss? Am I even making sense :) ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1343731285666576"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T13:47:14+0000","from":{"name":"آية محفوظ","id":"10154480818375773"},"message":"It is a subtle detail, but a programmer should be careful when using real and monotonic times.
