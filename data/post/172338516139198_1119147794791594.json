Your public key is shared to the world and your private key must be kept in the safest place. \n\nA lot of technologies depend on Public Key Encryption. For example, the https certificates. In your browser you will find several certificates for major companies. Actually these certificates are the public keys. In fact the public key of google and facebook exists in all the browsers in the world, while the private key is the most top secret in these companies.
