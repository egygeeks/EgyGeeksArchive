You can write this information to a file, DB, message queue, logging server, etc.\n\nA logging framework will do many things for you, like rolling files, handling multiple threads writing to log, log to multiple targets at the same time).\n\nWriting a file has many different purposes. You can write a configuration file, output results file, html file, etc.Writing a log file is one of these purposes.\n\nA lot of people do logging by writing to a file directly. Do this only for very simple things.\n\nYou should learn the logging framework for your programming language.
