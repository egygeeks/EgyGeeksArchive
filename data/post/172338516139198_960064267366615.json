You only have a pointer to it (Encapsulation)\nfopen and fclose, construct/destruct it.\nAll functions take a FILE* which acts like the this pointer.\nThe standard guarantees no padding at start of a struct, so you can make a SPECIAL_FILE with  FILE as first member and cast between them, given you know the composition of it (Inheritance).\n\nIf you want to go overboard, you can hack some preprocessor code for new/delete and make class-like things using structs of function pointers.\n\nFor private static members you can use different translation units (files) and declare them static.\n\nThat's what I could think of. There is a free ebook (http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/ooc.pdf) which I didn't have time to read yet. It surely has a lot more ideas on how to do this.\n\nAlso remember the very first C++ compiler was just a preprocessor for C. You can go a long way without explicit OO support.\nI even once saw a OO implementation in BATCH (yes, windows batch), but can't find it at the moment.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"960075777365464"},{"created_time":"2015-06-18T09:06:17+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmad Fatoum","id":"1068666063239339"},"message":"Another language I had limited exposure to is Lua.
