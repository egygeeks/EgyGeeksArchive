Should I keep it as a VM? Any ideas? thoughts?\n\nAdvantages of VM:\n\n1. Small \n2. Transferable\n3. Will contain all my software and configurations\n4. I have enough RAM to offer it great performance.\n5. Ubuntu only takes 450 MB when it starts anyway, so starting  #! in VM is negligible in performance difference than if I started it native.\n6. A 10 GB VM contains all my software  and learning needs. Easily transferable via USB and can just be ready to start again on any machine.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n1. It feels more organic just to boot it as main OS.\n2. It consumes few resources so I can use it as my VM host. (150 MB at start)\n3. It will relax my OCD tendencies to make it a full install.\n4. Full install won't be transferable.\n5. The lack of visual candy is relaxing to my brain, I actually feel so much better without it.\n\nAnyway, please share your thoughts with me, this is one of the few times in my life that I can't make a clear decision an it's killing me.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/888097484563294"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/888097484563294"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-01-30T02:40:58+0000","updated_time":"2015-01-30T18:38:22+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10155190776529497","name":"Ahmed Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTUxOTA3NzY1Mjk0OTcZD","after":"MTAxNTUxOTA3NzY1Mjk0OTcZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-01-30T02:54:34+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Negm","id":"10212131509466411"},"message":"running LMDE for 3 years,arch for 2 years, Ubuntu for 3 years\nand I love it,I never liked the idea of vms.\n\nif you want to isolate your work from your computer use crashbang and use vagrent for development on it.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"888101091229600"},{"created_time":"2015-01-30T02:59:10+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Sadek Mohamed Tawfik","id":"10154215525191922"},"message":"I used vmware to install ubuntu on external hard drive (talking about windows here) .. after that I booted from this drive into ubuntu natively .. so I guess I have the two options ready .. the annoying thing is that the hard drive is an external drive, and I kick the usb cable frequently :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"888102167896159"},{"created_time":"2015-01-30T03:01:07+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed M.

If I can give it 8 -10 GB RAM or even more, and it only uses 2 GB full load anyway? And with an SSD and #! resource handling I feel absolutely no difference, actually #! VM is faster cause it is just a Window manager and no eyecandy. I browse the web, write code.  Email is a web client. I play games on host OS, Ubuntu and basically Open Arena only. I am also interested in EMACS and if you know that is a bother to configure, you basically need an PHD.

One way is to place it on an external drive/usb  http://www.howtogeek.com/97923/how-to-boot-a-vmware-virtual-machine-from-a-usb-drive/ . I have seen people do this using VMware Server, but that would be an overkill in your case.\n\nAnother silly suggestion would be to setup a windows user that loads the VM on startup, and set that user to auto-login. So basically, if you open your computer and went to grab a bottle of water, when you are back you have your fullscreen VM running.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"888174971222212"},{"created_time":"2015-01-30T09:43:21+0000","from":{"name":"Essam A.
