There is a lot of discussion back and forth about its grammar. Some claim it's context-free, some say it's context-sensitive and ambiguous.\n\nBack in the days, a good C or C++ parser was a luxury (parsing C++ is notoriously complex than parsing C too). So clearly, Mohammad Tayseer's graduation project was to unravel C++ parsing. Pretty kick ass for a graduation project, he just used the term reverse-engineering for context that's all and his work might have actually been reverse engineering by a book's definition.\n\nToday we have the luxury of parser generator technology, compiler constructor toolsets and an increasing number of openly available grammars of mainstream languages.

We used an open-source C++ parser called OpenC++. It was easy to use, but it could parse only a subset of C++ standard. GCC is not reusable at all.
