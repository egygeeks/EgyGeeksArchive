Rather than using constant numbers (7, 8, and 9): (1) we generate a uniformly distributed value from range 0 to 1, and (2) we generate a CDF of a specific distribution, and sample from this CDF (e.g. zipf, uniform etc..).. Note that step number (2) is the values that the answer in stackoverflow compares against (7, 8 and 9).\n\nI wrote this code once in python, I am constructing the whole CDF, because the elements number was large:\ndef random_pick(alist, probs):\n    x = random.uniform(0, 1)\n    cumulative_probability = 0.0\n    selected_item = None\n    for item, item_probability in zip(alist, probs):\n        cumulative_probability += item_probability\n        if x < cumulative_probability:\n            selected_item = item\n            break\n    return selected_item\n\nNote that \"probs\" is the PDF of a specific distribution (not the CDF).
