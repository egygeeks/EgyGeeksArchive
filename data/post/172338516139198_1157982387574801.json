I can't help but remember Scott Aaronson's Quote : \n\n\"If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it’s found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffett. It’s possible to put the point in Darwinian terms: if this is the sort of universe we inhabited, why wouldn’t we already have evolved to take advantage of it? \" \n\nhttp://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=122","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1158194334220273"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUxT0RFNU5ETXpOREl5TURJM016b3hORFkxTXpZAMU56RTEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUxT0RFNU5ETXpOREl5TURJM016b3hORFkxTXpZAMU56RTEZD"}}}}
