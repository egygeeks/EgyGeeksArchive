Google is pushing for PWA and many companies are adapting it really fast! last year it was Flipkart this year there are new players:\n1. housing.com\n2. m.alibaba.com\n3. cnet.com/tech-today\n4. https://mobile-beta.westelm.com/\n\nthey also released a chrome extension to help you see where you are with PWA: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk\n\nFor emerging markets if you are seeing a weird behaviour (as us) when users install and uninstall your app 3-4 times a month i think the best way is PWA which doesn’t take much space with the add to home screen feature.\n\nSome numbers has been shared as well:\n\n1. Alibaba has seen 75% higher conversion on their mobile site after releasing their PWA.\n2. Alibaba users re-engaging 4x more often with site added to home screen.\n4. Prompting users sooner yields 48% more installs.\n5. 53% of users abandon sites that takes longer than *3 seconds* to load on a 3G network\n6. 18 Billion Push notifications sent daily and 50,000 domains using push.\n\n*Seamless Sign-in*\n\nAliExpress:\n-85% sign-in failure.\n+11% conversion\n\nPinterest:\n+10% increase in desktop logins\n\nHope this can help you find your way in anything new you are working on.","story":"Mohamed Alaa El Din shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"1252478278163674","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}],"48":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":48,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCrRz3Q1iFwf2JO&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Ftech-today%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fspin.gif&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQCv1QOxAwaoEjMe","link":"http://cnet.com/tech-today","name":"Tech Today","caption":"cnet.com","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1289102601129445"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1289102601129445"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2016-11-11T07:10:25+0000","updated_time":"2016-11-11T16:31:51+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10210546759477547","name":"Mohamed Oun"},{"id":"10212281470221629","name":"Mohamed Ali Abuelwafa"},{"id":"1914753818761647","name":"Ahmed Hosny"},{"id":"1142904185832197","name":"Mosaab Ahmed"},{"id":"1829457323960362","name":"Galal Aly"},{"id":"10210360907231721","name":"عبدالله محمد"},{"id":"10210277573008432","name":"Eslam Hamouda"},{"id":"10154097389365670","name":"Ahmad Alfy"},{"id":"952693524866956","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"},{"id":"10211811206896077","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},{"id":"1811475205784288","name":"Bassam Abd Elhamid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTA1NDY3NTk0Nzc1NDcZD","after":"MTgxMTQ3NTIwNTc4NDI4OAZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-11-11T16:31:48+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmad Alfy","id":"10154097389365670"},"message":"PWA are the future","can_remove":false,"like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"id":"1289632817743090"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEk0T1RZAek1qZA3hOemMwTXpBNU1Eb3hORGM0T0RneE9UQTUZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEk0T1RZAek1qZA3hOemMwTXpBNU1Eb3hORGM0T0RneE9UQTUZD"}}}}
