When you use the \"git flow\" command, it is way harder to make mistakes, and take a branch from the wrong place, or merge a branch to the wrong branch, or rebase on an outdated branch. This takes away a lot of human errors.\n\n2. I like rebasing on top of develop branch, it keeps conflicts contained in feature branches, and leaves the develop branch intact till the developer deliberately decides to merge back into develop. Every developer will fix the conflicts on their feature branch, and only they will suffer from broken code, not the whole team.\n\n3. I like the concept of \"release\" branches, very much.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"message_tags":[{"id":"10156033879973228","length":15,"name":"Hassan Ibraheem","offset":503,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1086652254707815"},{"created_time":"2016-02-25T21:38:10+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"Bottom line, it is not heaven, but it is really good.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1086653344707706"},{"created_time":"2016-02-25T21:40:36+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"Also, it is better for teams than for individuals.
