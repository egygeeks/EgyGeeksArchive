Especially the listen-to-article feature on Android. I was wondering if there is something as good as it on chrome or any browser?\n\nI tried (SpeakIt!) but it is not good.\n\n\"It also pronounces words with apostrophes as separate units. Ex: \"John's car\" is pronounced as John? S car. Did I mention that some voices just randomly pause during a speech? Ugh.\"","story":"Islam Azab shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154876688426014","name":"Islam Azab","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"39":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":39,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDh6qUxyLVqwi9P&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetpocket.com%2Fi%2Fv4%2Fsignup_graphic%401x.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDWDkinen2nIFDY","link":"https://getpocket.com/a/","name":"Pocket: Log In","caption":"getpocket.com","description":"When you find something you want to view later, put it in Pocket.","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1090785960961111"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1090785960961111"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2016-03-03T16:18:30+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-03T18:15:41+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1348336588561390","name":"Hosam Aly"},{"id":"2242378612654381","name":"Noha Azab"},{"id":"10212482712403270","name":"Morad Edwar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTM0ODMzNjU4ODU2MTM5MAZDZD","after":"MTAyMTI0ODI3MTI0MDMyNzAZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-03-03T16:26:09+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Adam","id":"10154930440846071"},"message":"I think pocket has plugins for all browsers, I am using Firefox plugin","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1090789607627413"},{"created_time":"2016-03-03T16:26:57+0000","from":{"name":"Islam Azab","id":"10154876688426014"},"message":"Yes, but I cannot listen to the article from it.
