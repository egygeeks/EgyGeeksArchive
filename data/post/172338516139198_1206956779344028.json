I was able to confirm that they were related to pre-set set of IP addresses(adding a new IP to the same server \"solves\" the problem). And using a network sniffer I was able see that the packets dropped are the ones related to TLS negotiation, meaning it's not a routing issue, but more likely a DPI situation. \n\nI am only asking because this is the first initiative I saw to actually talk to/expose ISPs. So, wanted to make sure all the information is available.. \n\nThere were several posts about this with a great deal of information in the the past few weeks, you might be interested in looking them up.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1207038802669159"},{"created_time":"2016-08-17T20:10:00+0000","from":{"name":"Abdelrahman Omran","id":"2022367384657074"},"message":"Well, some people claims it's a Deep packet inspection issue which could be true, but I can't get it why there's other similar websites, same region, same datacenter, same SSL certificates, but on different servers and it's working fine.
