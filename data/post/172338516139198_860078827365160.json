me about 3~4 days to make all templates initially (Usually the master/root template, homepage, 1 column and 2 columns templates) then after all website development is completed I spend about 1~1.5 day adjusting responsive stuff , testing, optimization, cleaning, styling new elements/components/widgets/templates that we added during the development .. etc.\n\nBack to the days before modern browsers and before Bootstrap and similar frameworks, having to support IE, a lot of hacking and browsers incompatibilities, a lot of testing-fixing-F5 cycles on multiple browsers simultaneously it was taking more 5~6 days or so.\n\nBut you know it depends, sometimes a homepage might take 4 days if it has some special UI widgets, animations or new requirements or eftekasat.. etc.\n\nThe more clear requirements you get and the more wire-frames/design/concept you get that covers all cases and answers all the questions that popup in your mind during the implementation the more it becomes a piece of cake and takes less time and efforts even if the design is sophisticated.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"860219330684443"},{"created_time":"2014-12-13T09:00:30+0000","from":{"name":"Yehya

For other sub pages.. the majority usually contain simple links, images, paragraphs.. etc, a few of them contain stuff like galleries, grids, tabs.. etc but styling them does not take a long time because they will inherit a lot of styles. You know by completing the homepage and the main templates you complete the styles for links, headers, different types of buttons, sliders, icons.. lists, containers, bread-crumbs and maybe forms too and so on which makes other pages almost get automatically styled.\n\nAm I slow or fast? I don't care because I believe that if I am slow and want to become faster I can easily do that by learning and practicing, I consider myself fast enough as long as I deliver the project on time and the client/boss is happy with the results.\n\nIf it is your boss who thinks you or your team is slow consider reading this:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/permalink/851742001532176/\n\nIf its you who think you are slow consider reading this:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/permalink/753488791357498/","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"860372764002433"},{"created_time":"2014-12-13T16:37:01+0000","from":{"name":"Yehya Hafez","id":"1814037031955164"},"message":"Moutaz Shams - Very rich comment..
