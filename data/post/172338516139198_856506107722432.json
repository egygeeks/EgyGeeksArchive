And I found two schools here out: \n\n1- Some says that the best start point is to start with (Python) \"Which is very closed to Ruby, so they thought as you did precisely\". At the top of universities who follow this track you will find Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) the best university in mathematical applications around the world, and here is the introductory course they study: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/\n\n2- Another approach is to start with (C++) \"or sometimes C\". And at the top of universities who follow this track you will find Stanford University the best university in Artificial intelligence and Algorithmic applications around the world. but I can't find it online yet. \n\nI like the second approach more, may be because I forced to follow it and found it interesting and useful. But the main reason is that you will need to learn more programming languages later such as Java, C#, JavaScript and/or PHP. And C++ syntactically is more similar to these languages' syntax than Ruby or Python. \n\nBut a very helpful fact that you should recognise before starting is that you will need to learn almost all of these programming languages: http://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-should-a-modern-day-programmer-have-in-his-her-arsenal\n\nFinally, if you are a computer science student, I think you should master this course before learning any programming language. It's a self study introductory course to the computer science with no deadlines as a field and which you will face in your extremely interesting and informative journey: https://class.coursera.org/cs101-selfservice.\n\nHope it's helpful, and if there are any other questions I'm in demand :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"message_tags":[{"id":"126533127390327","length":43,"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","offset":496,"type":"page"},{"id":"6192688417","length":19,"name":"Stanford University","offset":929,"type":"page"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"856526484387061"},{"created_time":"2014-12-05T13:59:18+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"أتوقع البوست بتاعك اتمسح، و البوست ده كمان ممكن يتمسح (أنا كأدمن موافق لو نفس الأدمن اللي مسح اللي فات عايز يمسح ده كمان)، لإن السؤال من أنواع الأسئلة اللي الصفحة هنا بتتجنبها. مافيش حاجة اسمها ايه رأيكم في الروبي. كله شغال.\n\nهنا مش مكان سؤال المبتدئين العام، و خصوصا مش مكان ايه رأيكم أشتغل بروبي ولا لأ. فيه ألف جروب للكلام ده على فيسبوك.الجروب ده حريص ما يبقاش الألف وواحد و يبقى مكان أنسب لأسئلة و مواضيع المحترفين اللي ليها معنى و إجابة.\n\nأنا أسف من سخافة الرد لكن لزم التوضيح.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"856528094386900"},{"created_time":"2014-12-05T14:14:51+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed ElSebaei","id":"1070821833062222"},"message":"Dude it was a joke and the guy asked a valid question. the group called egyptian geeks not egyptian software professionals.

The idea of \"experienced professionals\" is more at odds with the word \"geek\" cause a geek does not have to be a professional (make money out of his geekdom), but rather someone who does things for the fun of it.
