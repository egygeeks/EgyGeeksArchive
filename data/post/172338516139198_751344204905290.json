Where do you think I could find such open source stuff to look at? It's for study purposes basically, because I feel there's a gap in my knowledge that can only be filled with real world source code to look at but all I found in that regard is very complex applications. So any help would be appreciated.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/751344204905290"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/751344204905290"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","application":{"name":"Facebook for Android","namespace":"fbandroid","id":"350685531728"},"created_time":"2014-05-23T01:24:10+0000","updated_time":"2014-05-23T16:28:32+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"751374004902310","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"Pick a language.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-05-23T02:19:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"751441188228925","from":{"id":"687244496","name":"Ahmed Hassan"},"message":"Web stuff, I know php and Python as server side languages and all the other front-end stuff.
