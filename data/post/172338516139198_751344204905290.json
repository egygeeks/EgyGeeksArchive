Where do you think I could find such open source stuff to look at? It's for study purposes basically, because I feel there's a gap in my knowledge that can only be filled with real world source code to look at but all I found in that regard is very complex applications. So any help would be appreciated.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/751344204905290"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/751344204905290"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-05-23T01:24:10+0000","updated_time":"2014-05-23T16:28:32+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-05-23T02:19:37+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"Pick a language.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"751374004902310"},{"created_time":"2014-05-23T06:48:03+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Hassan","id":"10155190776529497"},"message":"Web stuff, I know php and Python as server side languages and all the other front-end stuff.
