I'm subscribed to Etisalat ADSL, this morning my Internet was not working. The ADSL line was working okay and the router showed correct upstream and downstream readings. However, the Internet was not working because the PPPoE interface was down (not connected). I filed a complaint and after a couple of hours the PPPoE was working fine. The irritating part is now whenever I try to open a page on any browser (on any device) it shows a notification from Etisalat that I can't discard (the continue button call a JS function that should redirect me back to the page I wanted but it doesn't work). I called tech support and spent 40 minutes trying to explain to some Frontline idiot that my Internet connection is fine (I even download router config files from Etisalat's website) but with no avail. \nSo is there any way to bypass this redirect mess? \nOr since this is PPPoE it is not possible? \n\nThe interesting part is that the only webpage that instead of being redirected to the notification page shows connection timeout is Facebook. I ran tracert to different Web pages and Facebook seems to have weird hops. The rest just kept being directed to the same host (the notification page).","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1154535424586164"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1154535424586164"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-06-02T09:38:35+0000","updated_time":"2016-06-02T09:55:11+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-06-02T09:55:11+0000","from":{"name":"Khaled Karam","id":"10211871392996817"},"message":"Fady Taher","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10158289564115263","length":10,"name":"Fady Taher","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1154540957918944"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUxTkRVME1EazFOemt4T0RrME5Eb3hORFkwT0RZAeE16RXgZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUxTkRVME1EazFOemt4T0RrME5Eb3hORFkwT0RZAeE16RXgZD"}}}}
