It's enjoying, and useful both on the personal level & the community level.\n\nIt just happens that most of my applications use maps. Maps can be used to represent a lot of data in a very convenient way, e.g. you can see the traffic congestion in Cairo in one look (Taree2y & Wasalny), know where most crimes happen (Zabatak), like harassments (http://harassmap.org/), measure the number of people who can fit in a geographic area (howmanypeoplefithere.rawa7.com), measure taxi cost for a given distance (http://mtayseer.github.io/my-taxi-ride/), transit analysis (rawa7.com), nearest restaurants (yelp.com).\n\nIn the past few week I've been researching how to use maps effectively, e.g. if you want to create a project which employs a map, how I can create it in the fastest way possible. A lot of my shared links in the past weeks are about this.\n\nBTW if you have learning materials about GIS in general, please share them. I know the basics only.\n\nPS: This comment is becoming its own blog post :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T09:26:32+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"652086411497737","from":{"id":"676490633","name":"Emad Mokhtar Habib"},"message":"Mohammad Tayseer You developed all of these apps using Python?
