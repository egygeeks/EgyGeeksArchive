If you got any helpful resource please share.\n\nThank you.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1314047465301625"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1314047465301625"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-12-05T13:40:29+0000","updated_time":"2016-12-05T23:16:45+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1256339067795513","name":"Mohamed Elmowafy"},{"id":"10154154089100216","name":"Nader Al-Sharkawy"},{"id":"1364997500240454","name":"Mohamed AbuIssa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTI1NjMzOTA2Nzc5NTUxMwZDZD","after":"MTM2NDk5NzUwMDI0MDQ1NAZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-12-05T13:51:50+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Negm","id":"10212131509466411"},"message":"I think you should stress test your app \nWrite an integration test to do that","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1314060688633636"},{"created_time":"2016-12-05T14:05:29+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed AbuIssa","id":"1364997500240454"},"message":"I guess this can help, it calculates benchmarks for different frameworks combinations. and it's really awesome. but I guess you should also test you own design and configuration.\nhttps://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r13&hw=ph&test=update","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1314078345298537"},{"created_time":"2016-12-05T16:51:48+0000","from":{"name":"Aly Saleh","id":"10155986640529899"},"message":"You could use apache jmeter to do load tests then you have an idea how much your whole system can handle, also while doing that you could log how much time of it did the database take and how much did the other layers take, just to know where the bottleneck is, if any","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1314243841948654"},{"created_time":"2016-12-05T16:52:26+0000","from":{"name":"Aly Saleh","id":"10155986640529899"},"message":"U can get the throughput, std dev and a lot more from jmeter http://jmeter.apache.org/","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1314244215281950"},{"created_time":"2016-12-05T22:46:26+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Samir Nouh","id":"10154986841093567"},"message":"12","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1314778398561865"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE14TkRBMk1EWTRPRFl6TXpZAek5qb3hORGd3T1RRMU9URXcZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE14TkRjM09ETTVPRFUyTVRnMk5Ub3hORGd3T1RjM09UZAzIZD"}}}}
