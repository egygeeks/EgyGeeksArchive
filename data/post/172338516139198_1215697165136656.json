I'm too attached to Java.\nI DO code other languages (python,ruby,C,C++), but when it comes to my choice, I always choose Java.\nEven when I started learning Server Side, I started with ROR. It's so powerful, but still I wasn't so enthusiastic about it, but once I tried JavaEE I just fell in love with it from the first line of code, thinking of the cool projects I can implement in Java.\nThe question is: Is what I'm feeling normal? Is it healthy? If not, why am I feeling this? And how can I overcome this?\nThanks in advance.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1215697165136656"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1215697165136656"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-08-27T08:49:58+0000","updated_time":"2016-08-29T12:32:58+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10207650498972339","name":"Ù…Ø¤Ù…Ù† Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø§Ø¯Ø±"},{"id":"10211393167241059","name":"Abdelrahman Hafez"},{"id":"1252883928113535","name":"Amr Ashraf"},{"id":"1333851406701774","name":"Ali Ismail"},{"id":"10210802666035298","name":"Ù…Ø­Ù…Ø¯ ÙŠØ§Ù‚ÙˆØª"},{"id":"1142904185832197","name":"Mosaab Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMDc2NTA0OTg5NzIzMzkZD","after":"MTE0MjkwNDE4NTgzMjE5NwZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-08-27T08:56:33+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Samir","id":"10158289338975702"},"message":"About coding in general, having Java as a preference is quite common.

Java is a great language and it is the most desirable language to know worldwide. Aside from that, it is fully OO with functional features and can run on all platforms. It is syntactically similar to C,C++ and C# and ECMASCRIPT, so I say coding in Java will only make you a better programmer. In addition to that, the Java frameworks are amazing, and you can learn a lot about architecture and design from them, just keep your ability to also wrote Python,Ruby, so you break your fear of switching to other styles of programming.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1215779068461799"},{"created_time":"2016-08-27T14:09:59+0000","from":{"name":"Amro Guzlan","id":"10155114910279393"},"message":"I usually do questions on hacker rank/ topcoder to get comfy with a new language.
