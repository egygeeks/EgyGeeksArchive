What are your goals from this optimization?\nEvery dimention in software development has its own optimizations.\nFor example, do you suffer from bad performance? Do you suffer from maintenance? Do you have security concerns..etc?\nI will give you general advice which I think will make you life happier:\n- perfect is the enemy of good enough, weigh your projects and put your efforts in the best place.\n- not all projects the same, and not all parts of the project have the same importance. Again, put your best efforts in parts that has the most ROI.\n- avoid plugging patterns and technologies in your application for the sake of just using them without real need or to put them in your resume. \n- Most of the optimizations you think you might need them, actually you will never need them. YAGNI\n- cleverness left the road for simplicity, it's hard to read code than to write it. If I have to recommend a single development practice, it will be writing clean code(actually, there is a book with the same name, clean code, which I think the number 1 must read development book)","can_remove":false,"like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"id":"1125646320808408"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5TlRNNU5EYzNNRGd6TXpVMk16b3hORFl3T0RBM05UTXgZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5TlRZAME5qTXlNRGd3T0RRd09Eb3hORFl3T0RNNE1UazIZD"}}}}
