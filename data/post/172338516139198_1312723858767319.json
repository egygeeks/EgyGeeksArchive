For example if your goal is to land a job, then start analyzing the job market where your hunting for the required skills and work on them. What I want to emphasize is to be able to trace what you do to what you want to get at the end. The result of this is not losing sight and feeling lost and not knowing what to do next. This exercise should help you to get a long prioritized TO-DO list. Do not complicate things, just a very simple process (a few hours) will get you the plan to where you want to get. And please revise your plan after each milestone - as you get more knowledge and the world changes you would need to adapt.
