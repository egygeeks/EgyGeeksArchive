Libraries like animate.css work flawlessly on Crosswalk (Thanks Alfy), Also You can use APIs like FileStorage, LocalStorage, Audio, etc. Some of those will require the proper <user-permission> tags in your manifest\n\n7) The app sometimes becomes less responsive and I felt the mobile overheat a bit, nothing objective here just an unsubstantiated observation but It safe to say that while you are using HTML/CSS you should always remember that you are running on a phone with limited resources and that chromium is not doing voodoo magic. If you do expensive stuff in your code your app will lag, drain battery and overheat the device\n\nThat's all I have for now, It was a 4 days hackathon I didn't have time to neither profile nor optimize the code so I think I might have more when I dig into that matter","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154097389365670","length":4,"name":"Ahmad Alfy","offset":1246,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"800391796667197"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOems0T1RnNE1ESXpORGMwTWpReE9qRTBNRGM1TmpReU1UYz0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPREF3TXpreE56azJOalkzTVRrM09qRTBNRGd5TkRjeE1qUT0ZD"}}}}
