I need to make sure the solution is clean before moving it into another PC inside the company network.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1391357780903926"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1391357780903926"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-02-17T14:35:38+0000","updated_time":"2017-02-17T19:11:20+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10155030523854840","name":"Ahmed Samir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTUwMzA1MjM4NTQ4NDAZD","after":"MTAxNTUwMzA1MjM4NTQ4NDAZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-02-17T14:38:21+0000","from":{"name":"Tony Raoul Iscaros","id":"10155085965723420"},"message":"You can't sanitize them manually ?
