Always be very sceptical re: performance comparisons\n2. Most lnockout performance issues come from the embedded jQueryTmpl template.

Read point 1 again, and then see how for example the backbone test appends HTML. this is a) direct HTML setting, which is sure faster than any templating b) is not how things are done in many cases in real world - one of the problems with these tests is always how many optimisations can be done vs. are actually done  \"per tested framework\" differs from one to another","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"516804755025904"},{"created_time":"2013-01-23T23:39:21+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Tayseer","id":"10154965677956341"},"message":"The question is: do you choose your JS framework based on performance?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"516808915025488"},{"created_time":"2013-01-24T15:41:24+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"Like all similar choices, you choose the best set of trade-offs.
