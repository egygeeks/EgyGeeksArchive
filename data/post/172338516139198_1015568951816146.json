For some reason, the third party can not connect to get files except through sFTP.\n\nI have installed Cygwin ssh server on windows and enabled sFTP and everything works fine. He can connect and get the files.\n\nHowever, for the automated process of getting files, the third party needs key-based authentication instead of a regular username and password.\n\nI have followed every single tutorial about enabling this ( 99% of the tutorials are for Linux based servers ) but had no luck.\n\nAnyone faced this situation before or can suggest a solution ?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1015568951816146"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1015568951816146"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-10-05T14:18:35+0000","updated_time":"2015-10-08T15:23:04+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154838763611066","name":"Shady M.

For those who want to know, Windows does not allow user context switching without providing explicit passwords. So, you will have to assign an administrator account to the cygwin server so it can use it for the impersonation process. I added the user and now, I can login using public key authentication normally as in Linux servers.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1016540981718943"},{"created_time":"2015-10-08T07:52:54+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Omar Zaian","id":"10154907377181047"},"message":"Good to know its resolved next time ISA do not use windows :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1016653791707662"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF4TlRVNU1qTXpPRFE0TURRM05Eb3hORFEwTURVNE1qVTIZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF4TmpZAMU16YzVNVGN3TnpZAMk1qb3hORFEwTWprd056YzEZD"}}}}
