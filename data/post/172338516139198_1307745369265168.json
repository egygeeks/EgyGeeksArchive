So I decided to follow CSS architecture with preprocessor. I have decided a Sass for the preprocessor but still try to find the best architecture that goes well with it. I did my research and I found that there are  2 or 3 or combination from them (BEM - SMACSS - rscss). Anyone suggest anything from his previous experience or a guideline you are very welcome.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1307745369265168"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1307745369265168"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-11-29T20:18:57+0000","updated_time":"2016-12-01T00:02:27+0000","shares":{"count":2},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1367406309985111","name":"Mahmoud Alaa"},{"id":"1244881555627116","name":"Ahmed Sayed"},{"id":"1338249162908533","name":"Hassan Hafez"},{"id":"1291762004205776","name":"Mahmoud Ahmed"},{"id":"1274494369294399","name":"عبدالرحمن محمود"},{"id":"1916630598571022","name":"Ahmed Tawfik"},{"id":"10154129783666537","name":"Adham Gad"},{"id":"10158458491135232","name":"Rasha Nour Eldin"},{"id":"1811475205784288","name":"Bassam Abd Elhamid"},{"id":"10154902980387597","name":"Mohamed Taraman"},{"id":"10211242369566436","name":"Ebram Tharwat"},{"id":"10211864148856342","name":"Ahmed A.

You have to take it step by step. Start with BEM. It's the best thing happened to CSS in the last decade and will give you a huge leap toward maintainability and scalability.\nRemember that BEM isn't just about the naming convention but also toward writing selectors with low specificity.\nOne more thing I learned from experience is; always refactor your code. No shame in gonig back and rewriting a module again to enhance it and make it more generic.\nYou should check OOCSS, basically separate structure from presentation. The most basic example to understand is using the grid example from frameworks like bootstrap when constructing anything that utilize a grid rather than rewriting it again. You should refactor your code never have 2 different ways to do one thing.\nLastly, you need to check ITCSS. It basically tell you how your files should be structured to improve your specificity graph. ITCSS help your project grow in size without growing in complexity. This video explain that very well\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4\nOne last thing ...

It keep your style bounded to the domain so when you go from page 1 to 2 you still have the CSS you wrote there.\nI start with the layout stuff (floats, directions, text-align) and move on to handling special cases later.\nI was working on a better strategy using a PostCSS plugin that generate the opposing version using the future syntax.
