I have Windows XP/Vista/7/2008/2012 matrixed with versions 9.3/10/10.1/10.2 of the software we're using.\nLet's say we have a library of these machines.\nThen, for every new case/test we need a separate instance that builds on one of these machines.\nHow do I do that (using Vagrant or anything else)?\n(please let me know if my description is not clear enough)","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/679754762064235"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/679754762064235"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-01-03T21:24:22+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-04T01:13:50+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"679774258728952","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"مُحَمَّد أبو آدم"},"message":"I think Virtualbox has something equivalent to Vagrant https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch11.html","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-03T22:26:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679776062062105","from":{"id":"652024918","name":"Amr Eldib"},"message":"My understanding so far is that Vagrant sits on top of VirtualBox (that was the first VM engine, then came others like VMware), and does this stuff using simple commands.
