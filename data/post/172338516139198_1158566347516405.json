Example 1 month before expiration.\n\nNotes: 1- We know that the registerer send notifications, but we need to add multi registerer and we need to set the notification time.\n\n2- We did a search on Google and found some like DomainTools.com but it did not monitor the hosting (if we used a shared hosting).\n\n3- One of my friends suggested to use Google Calendar, but that is a manual thing, we aim to get an automated service\n\n4- If we found that this service is not exist, then what about building one?\n\nThanks for your contribution.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1158566347516405"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1158566347516405"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-06-08T20:39:10+0000","updated_time":"2016-06-09T10:51:52+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-06-08T22:15:55+0000","from":{"name":"Mostafa Hussein","id":"599781276899213"},"message":"Alaa , 7lw el kalam da :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10210243495897310","length":4,"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1158605300845843"},{"created_time":"2016-06-08T23:31:45+0000","from":{"name":"Amir Abou Eesa","id":"1353018234756623"},"message":"I didn't get your point , you mean for example you re-sell a shared hosting from hostgator to client A , and another one to Client B , you need a tool to keep tracking of those hosting expiration date to remind you to renew ?!!!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1158631337509906"},{"created_time":"2016-06-09T02:33:27+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmad Hisham","id":"10158274819655058"},"message":"Use a registrar with an API like Amazon Route 53 and write a small script to automate your notifications.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1158704090835964"},{"created_time":"2016-06-09T09:00:05+0000","from":{"name":"Malak Mitch","id":"10154934633420638"},"message":"Have you checked whmcs.com ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1158874990818874"},{"created_time":"2016-06-09T10:51:13+0000","from":{"name":"Michael Henry","id":"10155149755210955"},"message":"Guys I have found this very usefull script that do exactly what am looking for, will try and let you know\nhttp://codecanyon.net/item/advanced-domains-and-hostings-pro-v3-multiuser/10368735?s_rank=7","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1158909637482076"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUxT0RZAd05UTXdNRGcwTlRnME16b3hORFkxTkRJME1UVTEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUxT0Rrd09UWXpOelE0TWpBM05qb3hORFkxTkRZANU5EYzQZD"}}}}
