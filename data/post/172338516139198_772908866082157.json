Basically with Grunt you have to do a lot of things manually. Let's say you are compiling Jade templates into HTML then concatenate the JS files and replace the group of links with only one then minify the HTML ... In Grunt you define the temporary folder where you store the HTML files after being compiled from Jade ... Then tell the next task to scan the files at the temp location and replace the tags with the new one and overwrite the temp files again then tell the minification process to act once again on the files in the temp location and finally copy it to your *build* directory ...\nWith Gulp it is totally different ... It's like chaining with jQuery ... For the sake of simplification it would be like:\nhtmlFiles.CompileJade().replaceTags().minify().moveToDist()","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-06-30T21:55:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"774487859257591","from":{"id":"695596001","name":"Muhammad Saleh"},"message":"So the only plus point for Grunt till now is the community..
