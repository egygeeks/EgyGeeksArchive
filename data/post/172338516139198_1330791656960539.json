So your advice to learn to \"master\" React, Angular or Angular2 is a bit off (same applies to CSS preprocessors & HTML preprocessors)\n- DON'T learn CoffeeScript, AMD, Grunt, underscore or Bower. All are dead. And HTML preprocessors are useless, you can pick it up in a couple of hours when needed.\n- w3schools is NOT a trusted references, MDN is great & enough.\n- Read many blogs not just only CSS-tricks.\n\nFor JavaScript:\n\n- You just need to learn JavaScript, no need to complicate things with TypeScript & stuff.\n- When you feel the need for a module system use ES modules. If you deal with node then use CJS & understand that both are not exacty the same.\n\nFor CSS:\n\n- Best CSS is vanilla CSS, no need for preprocessors. If you want imports & stuff look into PostCSS. But in general preprocessors is not a must have skill.\n- Don't learn Bootstrap or Material design or grids that comes with them, build your own & learn from that. They are bloated & will never be used in production for a serious product. \n- Learn about SVG instead of font-icons, which are bad for accessibility & not as flexible as SVG.\n\nFor HTML:\n\n- HTML is more powerful sometimes than what most people think it is, deeply understand tags, attributes & what you can do with them without CSS & JS.\n\n----\n\nWhen I do hire people for my team I only look for deep understanding of the stack (HTML, CSS & JS) most of the time I don't care about what tools or things they use. I look for the knowledge, frameworks comes & goes but knowledge is staying & it will enable you learn any framework or lib.\n\nLearn the basics, not the specifics. the rest is easy. And only learn things that solves your problems not because others are using it.","can_remove":false,"like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"id":"1330803970292641"},{"created_time":"2016-12-19T09:43:19+0000","from":{"name":"Mostafa Abdelaziz","id":"1776414295717910"},"message":"Moatasem Elrouby","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"1653829424644234","length":16,"name":"Moatasem Elrouby","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1331603260212712"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE16TURnd016azNNREk1TWpZAME1Ub3hORGd5TURZAek5UQTQZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE16TVRZAd016STJNREl4TWpjeE1qb3hORGd5TVRRd05UazUZD"}}}}
