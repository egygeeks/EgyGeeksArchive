I'm looking to get advice on an ideal Wordpress development environment/workflow. After some years of working inefficiently, and sometimes recklessly (often working directly on live sites, sometimes finding sites broken several steps in, and then resorting to backups, sometimes at a server level, and trying to remember the steps I took and want to renew), I'm trying to refine a better setup: Vagrant (under VirtualBox on OSX) for local WP development (initially using the VVV configuration, though I'm looking into other configurations) --> GIT for version control (using Tower for OSX: still learning my way around this one) --> Codekit to keep browsers automatically refreshed --> Beanstalk from Tower to push and pull branches to and from local to the production server (I'm looking into running all my sites from a single git repository, with domains segmented out in branches, so I can keep to the free, one repository Beanstalk plan) --> WP Sync DB Master plugin (a free fork of the premium plugin WP Migrate DB Pro that works perfectly for migrations and backups) to pull and push databases between local and remote without having to edit databases --> Command line cache purge for Cloudfare and MaxCDN where necessary (still working on this) ---> Automated backup to Dropbox from the production server using BackWPup plugin. I'm not there yet on all the above, but this is where I'm heading. I'd be very appreciative of any input, or alternative suggestions.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/910412578998451"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/910412578998451"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-03-16T20:38:42+0000","updated_time":"2015-03-17T16:03:30+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10212281470221629","name":"Mohamed Ali Abuelwafa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTIyODE0NzAyMjE2MjkZD","after":"MTAyMTIyODE0NzAyMjE2MjkZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-03-16T23:31:35+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Ali Abuelwafa","id":"10212281470221629"},"message":"I dont think its a good idea to make more than one website in one git repo. Bitbucket is an alternative which provides unlimited private repos and if  you can develop the whole website publicly then github is even better.\nFor big projects you can make your project-specific deploy scripts along with the use of post commit hooks to move your code from the repo to the hosting server (Research more on the topic of git workflows, bitbucket help is a great resource for this topic).\ngit-ftp is a useful command line tool to push files through git if I dont have full ssh access to the server (maybe old websites on shared hosting).\nconsider fitting grunt/gulp, and bower into your workflow to automate most of the repetitve tasks during development.\nFinally, your development workflow will be constantly evolving because tools come and go. So introduce new tools to your workflow as long as you see the value they provide to your project.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"910463402326702"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T05:29:27+0000","from":{"name":"Ian Douglas","id":"10155318352953690"},"message":"Thanks for the feedback. The reason I was looking to stay within Beanstalk was both to skirt around FTP (i.e., cut out a stage), but also for the GUI. I'm one of those (yes, I know) that tries to avoid the command line when I can. But perhaps I can find a way to integrate that function with Alfred, which is great for keyword or trigger scripting. I agree that it's better to have domains in their own repositories. Thanks for the other hints, Mohamed. You're right about tools continually evolving. No doubt in a year or two something will replace Vagrant, even.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"910595318980177"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T09:28:41+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"I havent tried beanstalk before, but have you tried Jenkins/Hudson for deploying through a UI","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"910667505639625"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T09:29:03+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"It will be a pain in the butt to configure at first, but it will be only done once and then you can easily copy and paste.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"910667572306285"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T09:30:16+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"http://jenkins-ci.org/","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"910667885639587"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T09:30:23+0000","from":{"name":"Mosab Ibrahim","id":"10154868571206047"},"message":"http://hudson-ci.org/","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"910667908972918"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T09:44:24+0000","from":{"name":"Ian Douglas","id":"10155318352953690"},"message":"Thanks for that, Mosab.

GitLab is a free opensource GIT repository wrapper with a quite neat web interface, just throw it on a 1 GB RAM instance from Linode, DigitalOcean or Amazon, and it'll do the job. Using post-hooks is a dirty way to do deployment, so if you'd rather go with Jenkins then you would actually opt the better option.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"910797785626597"},{"created_time":"2015-03-17T15:57:20+0000","from":{"name":"Amjad Mashaal","id":"10210954655734032"},"message":"Also, GIT command-line is really, really user-friendly.

At this point I'm really just beginning, so a GUI interface like Tower (which is very nice also) helps me figure out what this all is.
