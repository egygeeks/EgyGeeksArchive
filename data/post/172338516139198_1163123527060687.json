If no, then you can't do iOS development in a conventional way. If yes, you need to learn either Objective-C or Swift, then you can go ahead learn the iOS SDK and start writing iOS apps.\n\nIf you want to do Android apps, it's a similar fashion; you'll have to learn either Java or Kotlin, but the consensus is that Java is far superior for now, then working with the Android SDK to write android apps.\n\nIn both cases, you have to make sure you understand the OOP paradigms and how you can use them in the language you chose.\n\nNow what courses/books you might need is going to vary based on your experience--do you have any CS background?
