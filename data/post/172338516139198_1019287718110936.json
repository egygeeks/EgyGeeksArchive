English mathematician Ada Lovelace is widely considered the world's first computer programmer for her invention of the computer algorithm. Born in 1815 to the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Byron, Lovelace's mathematical talents led to an ongoing collaboration with mathematician Charles Babbage, who called Lovelace the \"Enchantress of Numbers.\" While translating an article by an Italian engineer on Babbage's Analytical Engine, a proposed early version of a mechanical general-purpose computer, Ada added her own set of notes which contained a tremendous breakthrough -- the first computer program or algorithm.\n\nAda Lovelace Day was started in Britain in 2009 as a day for creating new role models for girls and women in technical fields by raising the profile of today’s female STEM leaders. The event's founder, Suw Charman-Anderson, described the significance of this special day as follows: \"Ada Lovelace Day is not only about raising Ada’s profile, but also shining a spotlight on the achievements of all women in STEM, both historic and modern. It’s about drawing inspiration from all women, not just the famous ones, and supporting women at every stage of their career, from the choice of what to study at school and university through too often challenging professional milestones.\" \n\nIn honor of Ada Lovelace Day, please tell us about a historical or modern day woman in STEM who inspires you -- and, if it's someone you know personally, you can also tag her in the comments below.
