JS has only one type for numbers. That's why it is a pain in JS.\n\n\"in math infinity != infinity, NaN != NaN\" yes that's in math/logic, but in JS: Infinity does equal Infinity, null does equal null, undefined does equal undefined, null does equal undefined, BUT NaN does not equal NaN and does not equal anything. And what make this worse in JS is because it is untyped, it does not throw exceptions/errors in overflow and has crazy implicit type conversions.\n\nIn SQL I know that null != null and null != anything, and in C# null = null, but I am 100% comfortable with this in C# and SQL because there is a consistent philosophy in every language, but JS has no philosophy, it is made in two weeks with trial and error.
