Do you experience such delays with other ISPs?\n2. Do you think this is the local ISP problem, or it's a regional/global ISP issue?\n\nThanks in advance.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1297506086955763"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1297506086955763"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-11-18T19:08:41+0000","updated_time":"2016-11-20T12:13:09+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1413693455348322","name":"Mahmoud Essam"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTQxMzY5MzQ1NTM0ODMyMgZDZD","after":"MTQxMzY5MzQ1NTM0ODMyMgZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-11-18T19:17:41+0000","from":{"name":"Rafael Adel","id":"10155242150027122"},"message":"Yea sometimes..
