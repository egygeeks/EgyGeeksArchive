Currently, I have some huge Java code, like some classes are 1,000 lines of code or something. Don't worry, I am not asked to add a single line of code to it. However, I am asked to give some guidelines to the development team, whether we should refactor it. Cut it down into micro-services? Which parts should go into micro-services?? Hopefully, some day, we re-write parts of this code into more human-readable languages. \n\nSo, what I want is a tool that I can point it to the code and it gives me back some statistics, like how many modules are there, how many classes, how big is each class, number of lines is good enough approximation for the complexity to me. Maybe, some additional stuff, like which classes are more tightly coupled to each other or something. Anything else I need to know? Do you know any tools I can use for that?\n\nBig plus to CLI (please, please no eclipse-plugins), hopefully no bells and whistles, less than 50 MB, no Maven and XML-based configurations and such stuff from the 1990's.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1086316831408024"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1086316831408024"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-02-25T09:43:11+0000","updated_time":"2016-02-26T21:56:18+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154836693751858","name":"Mohamed Abdellatif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTQ4MzY2OTM3NTE4NTgZD","after":"MTAxNTQ4MzY2OTM3NTE4NTgZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-02-25T11:39:22+0000","from":{"name":"Shreef Ahmed","id":"10155198552956579"},"message":"I dont think that any tool can tell you which parts should turn into micro-services or not...  also worth  mentioning that micro-services are not good for all cases. \n\nAnyway, if you will just focus on basic code refactoring stuff, then there are hundreds of static code analysis tools that can give you more than what you asked for in the post. \n\nI'm not a java person, so I can't recommend any specifically. .. googling gave me this list\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1086361224736918"},{"created_time":"2016-02-25T11:41:10+0000","from":{"name":"Tarek Amr","id":"10154871355735944"},"message":"No no, I am not waiting for the tool to tell me that, just to give me basic hints what to inspect further myself","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1086365264736514"},{"created_time":"2016-02-25T13:25:10+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"Any method larger than 50 lines should be refactored, ask the people who work on the code for patterns, steps takes in the majority of methods","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1086422598064114"},{"created_time":"2016-02-25T13:25:28+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"P.S.
