What are your solutions for it ?\nDo you think you could use sth like that if it is free for example ?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1029544283751946"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1029544283751946"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-11-07T22:49:02+0000","updated_time":"2015-11-10T21:20:20+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"934652753304957","name":"Mohamed Hassan Soltan"},{"id":"1253681964729491","name":"Eslam Esmaeal"},{"id":"10158416724500711","name":"Mohamed Selim"},{"id":"10158307172615634","name":"عمر أمين"},{"id":"10155261619776614","name":"Mohamed Hamed"},{"id":"10154301446888199","name":"Pola Ashraf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"OTM0NjUyNzUzMzA0OTU3","after":"MTAxNTQzMDE0NDY4ODgxOTkZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-11-07T22:52:57+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"Ignoring the technical solution on purpose, how about another account?","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1029544977085210"},{"created_time":"2015-11-07T23:18:49+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"I love the idea from a 10,000ft view.
