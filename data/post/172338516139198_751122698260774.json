Which poses a problem.\nThe problem is in the consistent decline of post quality, this isn't a link sharing group, neither is it a place to post questions you can easily find their answers on Google if someone indeed invested the time to do so.\n\nWe set a high standard, I and many others do our very best to uphold it and expect others to do so. That way, everyone rises to the same bar. Those who can't, but show interest in improving, are helped.\n\nThe group is there for people of knowledge, to interact with those seeking knowledge. Knowledge on a personal level, a level you otherwise won't get from a link on HN/Reddit or an answer on Stack overflow.\n\nIf a post is outside what's deemed acceptable, it's given a proper buffer before being canned.\nI like the link, it's informative but if I apply that rule to X post, I will apply it to Z post. It's only fair.\n\nNothing gets deleted without a fair warning and nothing gets slammed down without constructive feedback.\n\nThe hope is, that people would interact.
