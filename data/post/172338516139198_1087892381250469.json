There are lots of cool and interesting tech people to follow on twitter, blogs .. etc. Why don't we share some of those accounts with a small summary of who they are and what do they usually tweet about. Maybe we can find some interesting people to follow.\nAs an example I'd start by:\n\n- @chrishunt : A github engineer, one of the best speakers I've ever seen. I started using tmux after watching one of his talks. His podcast is nice also. Other than tech, he has some talks on memory and solving rubik's cubes. Watch his talks.\n\n- @Nick_Craver : A stackoverflow developer and sys admin. I've mentioned him before. He tweets a lot about SO's architecture and stats and he's currently writing a series of blog posts about SO's architecture, hardware, .. ( https://trello.com/b/0zgQjktX/blog-post-queue-for-stack-overflow-topics ).\n\n- @fatih : Software Engineer at Digital Ocean and the developer of the famous vim-go plugin. Most of his tweets are about Go.\n\n- @antirez : The creator of redis.\n\nThose are the people I have in mind right now. Whenever I remember someone new I'll add him in a comment.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1087892381250469"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1087892381250469"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-02-27T21:22:43+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-06T00:56:58+0000","shares":{"count":1},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1193696477394500","name":"Ahmed Rabie"},{"id":"617625178429378","name":"Babayega Linux"},{"id":"1360592964014097","name":"Ahmed Mahmoud"},{"id":"1285105998248677","name":"Ahmed Badawy"},{"id":"1192494200869672","name":"Abdo Hussein"},{"id":"10212535367838308","name":"Salma Yehia"},{"id":"10208920707679294","name":"Nada Yahia Dawoud"},{"id":"1317803628265220","name":"Ahmed Gaber"},{"id":"10208553269172447","name":"Shiba Sinceta"},{"id":"10154899131416136","name":"Mera Tag Eldin"},{"id":"10211887209872216","name":"Islam AbdelMohaimen Hassan"},{"id":"10210619030863491","name":"Ashraf Hamdy"},{"id":"10158289051555364","name":"Mohammad Khatib"},{"id":"1254948201287289","name":"عمر ابراهيم"},{"id":"10158142026600408","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad"},{"id":"10154848480040219","name":"Ahmed Elramly"},{"id":"1263319723721469","name":"Ahmad Hassan Posten"},{"id":"10154868571206047","name":"Mosab Ibrahim"},{"id":"10158340042205183","name":"Mahmoud Said"},{"id":"10158350493475716","name":"Islam Mustafa"},{"id":"1666163166733719","name":"ابراهيم محمد"},{"id":"10154511379887689","name":"Mohammed Farghal"},{"id":"10158224231920062","name":"Omar Sherif"},{"id":"10158278217715564","name":"Ramez Ashraf"},{"id":"10154552804662523","name":"Ibrahim Sharaf ElDen"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTE5MzY5NjQ3NzM5NDUwMAZDZD","after":"MTAxNTQ1NTI4MDQ2NjI1MjMZD"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/172338516139198_1087892381250469/likes?access_token=EAAEFxxeGv2oBAIFNSMx76u4iTy5p0wJkZAVIn8sDUE2sEapZCKp5TFXrU9gmzZAVP2OzZApoKkOnf7qkJxKZCcSnG4jlZA2s4IQXRvZBZApCvhtOUcTZCZA9WOwZAZByvvWZCC6XfHH3DTalhmkWOpEGJrcaUZCS8IPpdp008ZD&limit=25&after=MTAxNTQ1NTI4MDQ2NjI1MjMZD"}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-02-27T21:29:47+0000","from":{"name":"Adam Zahran","id":"1616318368386204"},"message":"لازم twitter؟ :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1087897934583247"},{"created_time":"2016-02-27T21:30:24+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Josef","id":"1344461435593359"},"message":"@jeffrey_way and @chriscoyier","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1087898031249904"},{"created_time":"2016-02-27T21:41:41+0000","from":{"name":"Adam Zahran","id":"1616318368386204"},"message":"- Mohammad Elkhatib: https://github.com/mkhatib\nThe developer of Manshar.
