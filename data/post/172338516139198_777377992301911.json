Having to keep the mobile leveled at a 90° angle, very uncomfortable. \n\nNonetheless, the sensitivity is much better than your previous game so that's progress right there.\n\nThe menu and HUD need a lot of work, there should also be some way to turn off the music/sound volume.\nWhen I started playing and wanted to leave, the back button didn't do much, I eventually had to pause and click Main Menu.\n\nFinally, you probably played beach head before, beach head got boring pretty quickly but was still fun to play because they did a fantastic job at keeping the game intense and its difficultly escalated pretty quickly.\n\nThey also constrainted the view angle so you only had a limited FOV to worry about, I think your best bet with this game being unique enough is ditching the open landscape. \n\nImagine the player garrisoned in a building that's about to fall apart, the players job is to secure the building from multiple fixed points, say two or three windows that overlook a couple of street corners in a town being overrun by Germans, Aliens or god knows what,  zombies work too :D\nThis gives you a controlled environment, with little art work to worry about and much more exciting game play mechanics\n\nNot to mention the plot would make much more sense.\n\nBeach head took the shooter genre to a whole new level and a couple of others as well, they pioneered the mechanics but failed on the overall scenery challenge, plot and mechanics variety.\n\nGood luck.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"777628225610221"},{"created_time":"2014-07-06T16:04:20+0000","from":{"name":"Mostafa Yahia","id":"10211945267005669"},"message":"Thanks Very Much Hady \nyou are full of right in your comment \nand as i said \nit is first version of the game \nand the updates will be alot in next days for treat some problem and improve graphics and design in the game ! \nalso \ni have target after that \nis to make some options for control \naccelemerator and joystick \ni will give you the option to choose which control , you want \nthen there will be some improving to make levels like beach head \ni am working alone in the game \nso every thing i do i have to do it individually \nthat is little bit take more time than normal \nand thank you vey much for your comment \ni appreciate it :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"777824102257300"},{"created_time":"2014-07-07T17:29:45+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Ibrahim","id":"1409967155690056"},"message":"unity game right ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"778673175505726"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOemMzTmpJNE1qSTFOakV3TWpJeE9qRTBNRFEyTXpFd05EST0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOemM0Tmpjek1UYzFOVEExTnpJMk9qRTBNRFEzTlRReE9EVT0ZD"}}}}
