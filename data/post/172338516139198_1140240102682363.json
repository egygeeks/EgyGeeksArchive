It's easier to use, has better cross-platform support, and guards the user against a lot of common mistakes.\n\nGit is a powerful tool. Probably too powerful for most people. It also assumes its user to be an informed, power user. It used to do very little to guard against some common mistakes, but I've noticed that it has become better at that in recent versions.\n\n Technically speaking, it's possible to clone a Git repository into Mercurial while keeping all its information, but sadly it's not possible to do that the other way around, because Mercurial stores more metadata about your commits than Git does.\n\nMany people think that Mercurial is \"better\" than Git, in a similar sense to saying that Java is \"better\" than C++. And, of course, many people think the opposite is true. It takes a true engineer to appreciate the character and the different priorities of these systems.\n\nThe thing that made Git so popular is GitHub. GitHub has really made a lot of difference in everybody's lives. Its impact on our lives can only be compared to Google Search or to the invention of the Internet.\n\nوفر من بازار فرارك من الأسد :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1141225612583812"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUwTURJME1EZAzFOakF4TlRZAeU1Ub3hORFl5TnprME5EQTEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEUwTVRJeU5UWXhNalU0TXpneE1qb3hORFl5T1RJME16VTIZD"}}}}
