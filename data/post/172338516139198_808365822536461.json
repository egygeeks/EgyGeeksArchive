I need a simple wordpress popup plugin that allows me to write custom HTML content for the pop up and set a delay time (to allow visitors to read the page before showing the pop up). Anyone has some personal favourites for this?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/808365822536461"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/808365822536461"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-09-02T21:24:21+0000","updated_time":"2014-09-02T21:26:16+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-09-02T21:26:16+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"A few disclaimers: I really appreciate it if you are going to google the topic for me, but I'd appreciate personal picks more than promising google results, as I have been trying several of those now and got tired of random tries. Also, if you think the entire pop up thing is bad, then I have a lot of explanation to do, but that's not the topic of the question.
