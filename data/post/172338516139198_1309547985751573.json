Performance and optimization are non factors really.\n2-It must be possible to build the final product using all or most of at least the business logic and the frontend. \n3-Scaleability is a must.\n4-Must be very very flexible\n5-Cloud ready. \nI think you have an idea of what I'm looking for. But here is the fun part. The suggested stack is meant to be used by a small team of web developers who are familiar .Net framework but willing to invest time and effort in something else BUT with minimum time/effort \nThank you  .","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1309547985751573"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1309547985751573"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-12-02T01:00:28+0000","updated_time":"2016-12-02T07:40:56+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10155874856752738","name":"Ibrahim Zaki"},{"id":"1448981871792319","name":"Mohamed Abdelrahman"},{"id":"10155058995938618","name":"Emad Mahdy"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTU4NzQ4NTY3NTI3MzgZD","after":"MTAxNTUwNTg5OTU5Mzg2MTgZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-12-02T01:03:58+0000","from":{"name":"Osama Soliman","id":"709206249239999"},"message":"Ionic HTML5 Mobile Framework is that what u looking for ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"message_tags":[{"id":"1321836767955949","length":28,"name":"Ionic HTML5 Mobile Framework","offset":0,"type":"page"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1309549285751443"},{"created_time":"2016-12-02T01:05:40+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Helal","id":"419061701779054"},"message":"You can start with Xamarin Forms, then do the customization for the target platform.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1309550005751371"},{"created_time":"2016-12-02T01:22:44+0000","from":{"name":"Hussein Ghaly","id":"10158391110790193"},"message":"Phonegap/ Phonegap build","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1309561355750236"},{"created_time":"2016-12-02T04:32:24+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"First do it, then do it right and then do it better.
