Would it be some sort of blocking via Tedata?\n\nThanks","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1359294087443629"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1359294087443629"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-01-19T18:01:36+0000","updated_time":"2017-01-20T02:05:00+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1305943819490269","name":"Ahmed Aziz"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTMwNTk0MzgxOTQ5MDI2OQZDZD","after":"MTMwNTk0MzgxOTQ5MDI2OQZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-01-19T18:06:24+0000","from":{"name":"Maged Eladawy","id":"1220459164735315"},"message":"SSH or http cloning?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1359296407443397"},{"created_time":"2017-01-19T18:09:37+0000","from":{"name":"Hany El-Kerdany","id":"10154127396070989"},"message":"Happened to me a billion times and after waiting a while it works.
