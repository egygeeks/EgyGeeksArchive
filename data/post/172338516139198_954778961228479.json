(I know its odd but it happened!)\nTwo years ago, A colleague  was interviewing some developers for a senior position, and one had satisfied and met all the requirements.\nHe didn't hide his shallow hands on experience weakness, but rather than that, he was perfect in all other aspects. He even challenged us if we can come up with a technical issue he cannot solve, we've thoroughly tested him in the following:\n* Oveloading, Overriding, Constructors and Destructors.\n* Static VS Object properties and methods.\n* Magic Methods __get() and __set()\n* SQL injections\n* Security best practice for accessing and retrieving data from DB.\n* DB Shriding Techniques.\n* Clustering ..\n* Cloud Computing\n* SOAP VS REST\n* Case studies.\n* Decision making.\n* Implementation Scheduling.\n* Client handling.\n\n.... These are what I can recall now....\n\nWe've end up with a developer that only needs more life scenarios to be fully qualified for the position...\nActually I was hesitating to give him the position, but the decision wasn't mine.\nHowever, he got it ... and he showed some serious developing skills ...\nHis secret was just simple: He Never Stop Learning and Fetching New Area of Knowledge...\nSo.. What do you think?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/954778961228479"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/954778961228479"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-06-06T02:33:20+0000","updated_time":"2015-06-08T00:44:39+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10212004913375951","name":"Mahmoud Kandeel"},{"id":"10155335676276062","name":"Tarik Ibrahim"},{"id":"10154301446888199","name":"Pola Ashraf"},{"id":"10154838763611066","name":"Shady M.
