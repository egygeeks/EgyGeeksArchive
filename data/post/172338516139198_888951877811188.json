I've got a little problem there...\n\nOriginally I'm a PHP developer, but I work with a framework I've made myself. I edited some front-class-interface file I've found out somewhere and I combined it with Symfony2's Universal Class Loader. It was a difficult job but it ended up as something perfectly customized for my needs, I used that to implement few projects and it was perfect.\n\nBut when I think about this project, I need to use something that has more solid rules, like a solid framework or so. I tried CodeIgniter but honestly I don't believe it would be the perfect choice for something like that, especially after the discontinued support and then lending it to another organization and so.\n\nI never worked with NodeJS nor Meteor (and I mentioned Meteor because even though it's not popular, I've heard incredibly positive feedback about it) so I don't know whether those would be a better choice or not.\n\nSo, what do you guys think? Which framework should I use for something like that? Or should I use my native thing?\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe back-end should be a simple API that receives some data and returns a URL. There's a lot of processing done in the background though, specifically MHTML to HTML conversion and a lot of regex stuff. There should also be protection against spam so there will be a database that logs user entries where old entries get purged every while and then.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/888951877811188"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/888951877811188"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-02-01T01:16:46+0000","updated_time":"2015-02-09T04:50:31+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-02-09T04:50:31+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"1. Don't Use Meteor :) it sucks! I've used it before in a production app and I ended up converting it to PHP (I'm not a PHP Fan!)\n\n2. You can use silex if Symfony2 you feel it big for this application  https://igor.io/2013/09/02/how-heavy-is-silex.html\n\n3. Another big candidate if not the best for this task is GoLang. Use it for your backend and you can take advantage of Martini for parsing and even saving it as a Markdown https://github.com/go-martini/martini\n\nBest of Luck!","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"892808457425530"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPRGt5T0RBNE5EVTNOREkxTlRNd09qRTBNak0wTlRjME16RT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPRGt5T0RBNE5EVTNOREkxTlRNd09qRTBNak0wTlRjME16RT0ZD"}}}}
