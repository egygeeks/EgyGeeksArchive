{"id":"172338516139198_720854594620918","from":{"name":"Mohammad Tayseer","id":"10154965677956341"},"message":"I created an open-source app called \"Cairo: Streets & Stories\"[1], shared by Khaled M. Diab & originally suggested by the journalist Ismail Al Eskandarani. The idea is to convert the book of the same name[2] to an interactive map with rich info & images. It allows end-users to enter the data.\n\nBecause of the nature of the app & that Egyptians rarely do crowd-sourcing, my budget for hosting the initial version is zero. Also I will put ads in there, so if the site gets a lot of traffic, it can cover its own hosting  money.\n\nLet's dive in technicality: In the beginning I thought that I would make it a static website hosted on gh-pages & use GitHub for editing geojson, but GitHub uses maps for viewing only, not editing. Also, GitHub is not Egyptian-end-users-friendly.\n\nNow I have to make a dynamic part, so there are the options in my head now\n\n1. Use gh-pages for the front-end & a small back-end to edit geojson & upload images to github. I'm still thinking of the best way to do authentication.\n\n2. Make a dynamic app on AppEngine. I get a free instance, but I will be locked.\n\n3. Make a dynamic app on Heroku (or a similar thing?). I want a free instance with DB storage.\n\n4. What is the best option to store images? Flickr gives 1TB free, but I'm open to suggestions\n\n[1]: https://github.com/mtayseer/cairo_streets_stories\n[2]: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289626","message_tags":{"77":[{"id":"10212550395463324","name":"Khaled M.
