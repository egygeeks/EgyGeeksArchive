It's also far from being user friendly, certainly breaks out of the expected UX for a windows consumer.\nAlso, albeit I'm no fan of Air or just about anything developer related from Adobe* but by all means, AS and the Air runtime are amongst some of the most well documented platforms I've stumbled upon. However, in all fairness, Adobe's developer resources is just sincerely painful and their IA is badly designed.\n\nSpecially if you are building plugins for say, Photoshop or any other of their tools. Also, there seems to be a very blurred line between \"Free\" and \"Paid\" in Adobe developer tools, almost always you'll find yourself about to pay if you aren't too careful or if you didn't dig hard enough for an alternative.","message_tags":[{"id":"100004021358799","name":"Ala Frg","type":"user","offset":0,"length":7}],"can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-02-06T14:34:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"697174466988931","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"Ala Frg I believe you didn't grasp my comment well enough. \nI said \"your solution is far from the OP's problem\"\nAnd I said \"I'm no fan of Air\".\n\nYou also clearly missed out on a critical requirement mentioned by the OP, it has to be packaged as an executable file. And it's not about opening up a webpage in a browser, you can write do this in C and get done with it.\nIt's about embedding the iFrame, the OP wants an executable that checks for connectivity, finds it then loads an iFrame within the application's window. If not then it'll display a message.\nSo how do you propose embedding an iFrame with a shell script?\n\nLastly, good for you for migrating from Air. But please stay objective when you present a counter argument to a platform and state hard evidence to your claims. \"Platform is very stupid\", \"Security issues\" and \"Lack of documentation\" simply doesn't cut it through. A platform is only as good as for what it's intended to be used for.\n\nIf you try to build a web app in assembly, you certainly can but that'd be stupid, painful, very likely exploitable and certainly for that task, documentation would be lacking. That doesn't mean that assembly with it's various assemblers aren't well documented.\n\nLike I said, I'm no fan of Air but I'm also no fan of unfair technical assessments.","message_tags":[{"id":"100004021358799","name":"Ala Frg","type":"user","offset":0,"length":7}],"can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-02-06T15:19:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"697195370320174","from":{"id":"100002045429029","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din"},"message":"Yes but most of the windows users has .NET framework pre-installed or at least the basics to run an non-fancy exe file without the need to tell the user you need to install this app. the Tidesdk looks awesome as the only functionality of the app will be to open a website. nothing more and nothing less.
