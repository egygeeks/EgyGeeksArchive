But I like Laravel. \n\nSince I started coding with PHP (that was 7+ years ago), I was never comfortable using someone else 's code, so I never bothered to learn to use a framework or a CMS. I always loved writing everything from scratch.\n\nMy first framework (I named it \"Unique\") was very simple and lightweight, I loved it so much and decided to use it and work more on it, hoping that someday I could open-source it and share it with the world.\n\nAfter 3 years of development and about 10+ projects it became more sophisticated and elegant, I named it \"Zonda\".\n\nNowadays, it's more awesome than ever. And it's called \"Rhino\", it's basically an HMVC, but instead of the Model part I use something that I call \"DB Handlers\", and instead of the View i use \"Widgets\". \n\nRhino is so unbelievably fast, lightweight and secure. And it was intended to build Web Apps, not websites. I love this thing sooo much, here are some code sample:\n\n$clients = DB_Clients::whereNameLike(' ... ')->orderByName()->limit(10)->get(['name', 'website']);\n\nDatabase\\Connections::get('master')->databases();\n\nDB_clients::backup();\n\n$dir = new Files\\Directory( ... );\n$dir->files(['php', 'psd'])->delete()->backup();\n\nPlus so much more ...","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"message_tags":[{"id":"1809964769326531","length":18,"name":"Ashraf Abdel Aleem","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"954049061301469"},{"created_time":"2015-06-04T13:53:35+0000","from":{"name":"Abdulla Ahmed Seif","id":"1284974044915250"},"message":"Ahmed Zain Mohammed تقدر ترفع الفريم وورك بتاعك نشوفه  بالإضافه هل هو موثق (inline doc)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10155252594718081","length":19,"name":"Ahmed Zain Mohammed","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"954118607961181"},{"created_time":"2015-06-04T14:06:33+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Zain Mohammed","id":"10155252594718081"},"message":"Ah documentation kamel :) \n\nMaybe soon, I've been wanting to put it on Gitup for so damn long, but I keep telling myself: Why, no one would use it, it will be ANOTHER PHP FRAMEWORK","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"954123224627386"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVFV5T1RRd01UazBOelExTmpnNU9qRTBNek15TXpFeU9EYz0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVFUwTVRJek1qSTBOakkzTXpnMk9qRTBNek0wTWpZAM09UTT0ZD"}}}}
