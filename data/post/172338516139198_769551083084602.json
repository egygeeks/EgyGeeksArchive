It is not an Egyptian issue, we all know about the NSA (National Security Agency) scandal in USA and documents leaked by Edward Snowden, this made a worldwide movement to combat surveillance agencies.\n\nLetâ€™s share our knowledge in combating the surveillance. We all know about Tor but there is lots of great open source software which provide alternatives for untrusted widely used proprietary software.  Check this site out: http://prism-break.org/en/ and you will find alternatives you never heard about before. Keep in mind any way, if you want to have privacy, you will have to sacrifice usability and performance.","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/769551083084602"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/769551083084602"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-06-23T14:53:42+0000","updated_time":"2014-06-23T14:53:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1246823411","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},{"id":"687244496","name":"Ahmed Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg3MjQ0NDk2","before":"MTI0NjgyMzQxMQ=="}}}}
