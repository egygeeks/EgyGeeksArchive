Focus on what matters for your career. i.e. as Software Engineer. So\n- It doesn't matter to write that you know XHTML & HTML5 (I don't even think it matters to write that you know HTML if you wrote that you know jquery for example\n- XML (or all its related technologies, believe me no one is expecting someone who doesn't know what XML is)\n- Waterfall \n- IDEs \n- Web Servers\n- Issue Tracker\n- CVS / SVN. (If you wrote you know git, that's enough)\n- Atom, MySQL workbench, PhpMyAdmin, Trello (They might ask in the interview what's your fav. IDE, but believe me no one will select you for a job cause you know Atom or use Eclipse)\n- in OS(you used Platform which I don't find really accurate): Just put Linux (which level, power user, strongly experienced ..etc) and  Windows. No need to write Windows xp, 7 & 10 (unless you're a sysadmin who will be chosen for being strongly familiar with all Windows editions)\n- Soft Skills, I find that personally no longer needed or viable simply cause someone won't reject you cause you didn't write you a fast learner, and also no one will choose you cause you wrote you are.\n\nOverall you did a good job in summarizing your CV and again this is just my opinion","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1409163279123376"},{"created_time":"2017-03-04T20:57:14+0000","from":{"name":"محمد عرفة","id":"10154943779149651"},"message":"if the resume is going online. stick it full of anything you have ever touched. believe me it helps when a recruiter is looking. believe me i once wrote \"coordinated between my dept and network dept\" and now i get job offers that require ccie","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1409210689118635"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T03:48:26+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Aboulenein","id":"10158457549660438"},"message":"\"Reduce the skills section significantly\".... that really depends on who is reading your resume, a machine or a human? And if human, technical or recruiter looking for matching keywords. Some software (or may be many) parses and indexes resumes then sort them with the number of matching keywords. This makes a difference when there are hundreds of applicants, so the less keywords in your resume the lower your resume is rated - if it even appears. If a human and non-technical, that's really tricky. My manager somehow liked my performance and another colleague whose name happened to be Ahmed as well - a very rare coincident, he sent our resumes to the recruiter asking him to find people of similar profiles. Guess what? He brought him a candidate named Ahmed, haha. That might be okay in Cairo where there so many Ahmed, but it's not very common to find software engineers called Ahmed in Toronto with profiles similar to ours. Unfortunately he didn't have the needed skills and didn't even get a phone screening interview! A technical human who would understand that SVN and Git are similar and he has enough time to do a first scan of resumes. That's usually an Engineer busy with other tasks. My guess it's a low probability but may still work out for some. I would suggest you keep all the keywords but if you don't like them from a formatting perspective, you may want to push them to the bottom under Detailed Skills or Keywords section and have a summary at the top. In such a case and in the summary, I may choose to write version control systems instead of SVN or Git. These are always personal preferences and different resumes format reflect our different experiences after all - or so they should.
