What I thought of is to generate and distribute different shortened URL's for each cohort, each of these URL's redirects to my server to generate a cookie/file containing the cohort ID and place it on the user's machine, and then takes the user to Chrome store to download the extension. Once downloaded, the extension reads the cookie/file and saves the user ID together with its cohort ID in the backend. I am not a developer, so I am not sure whether this is feasible or it's science fiction :) Your suggestions are most appreciated!","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/879236802116029"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/879236802116029"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-01-11T16:28:42+0000","updated_time":"2015-01-12T17:42:58+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10210954655734032","name":"Amjad Mashaal"},{"id":"10154884040385170","name":"Meligy"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTA5NTQ2NTU3MzQwMzIZD","after":"MTAxNTQ4ODQwNDAzODUxNzAZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-01-11T17:19:16+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Tayseer","id":"10154965677956341"},"message":"This is somehow related to A/B testing\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"879252575447785"},{"created_time":"2015-01-11T17:43:14+0000","from":{"name":"Amir Abdel-Rahman El-Sherbiny","id":"10154250785875933"},"message":"Yes, A/B testing is usually used to help website owners track the users' behaviors on different versions of the same landing page.

Mohamed Meligy: Yes, your idea for Google analytics may work to track conversions. I will think it through. However, I am not sure Google analytics will be helpful beyond conversion. For example, if I want to measure and compare the average lifespan of each cohort, I don't think this will be possible through Google analytics. I guess, only a segmented database in the backend can help tracking all cohorts' behaviors accurately.
