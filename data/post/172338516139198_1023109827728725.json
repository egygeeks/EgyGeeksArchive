I decided to go with Legacy Boot and It managed to boot and I got Ubuntu menu setup. the colors and background were corrupted, Ignoring that I proceed with \"installing Ubuntu\", command window starts initializing setup files and It end with errors like this: http://i.imgur.com/fAnp1jz.png and machine didn't respond after that. After searching for what is \"nouveau\" .. I realized that there's a problem with my NVidia driver. Now if I run the installation again with parameter ACPI=off, do I risk my machine?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1023109827728725"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1023109827728725"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-10-23T17:47:48+0000","updated_time":"2015-10-23T18:46:59+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10212782797230132","name":"Diaa Sami"},{"id":"10210708672824531","name":"Amr Yassin"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTI3ODI3OTcyMzAxMzIZD","after":"MTAyMTA3MDg2NzI4MjQ1MzEZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-10-23T17:52:06+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Al-Amir","id":"10155179919799180"},"message":"Risk your machine as in risk hardware damage?
