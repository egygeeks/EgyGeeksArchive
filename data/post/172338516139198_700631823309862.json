The question becomes, do you expose that complexity or not?\nA concept like KISS is not about keeping everything simple at core, it's about keeping everything simple at the top layers. Where the user is bound to interact with a system 8 hours a day like clockwork.\n\nThe problem a lot of people face is when to use what and why. If I see this on basecamp, rest assured I'm cancelling my account two minutes after.\nIf I see this on my girlfriend's contact us form, I'll think that shit is cute and bookmark the page.\nYou have to ask yourself, is it necessary? Does it help the experience? Well, if it doesn't help, does it break the experience? For a bank entry form, yes. For a pap's and mom's website, no.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"700714976634880"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekF3TmpNMk56UXpNekE1TXpjd09qRXpPVEl6TURjME5qVT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekF3TnpFME9UYzJOak0wT0Rnd09qRXpPVEl6TVRnd05EUT0ZD"}}}}
