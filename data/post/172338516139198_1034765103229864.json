The prize will be a gift from one of our sponsors.\n\nI have been thinking. Maybe create a new post in my blog and email it to the group, allow users to use Disqus image upload feature to upload images as comments, and other users can upvote comments.\n\nThis has 2 issues:\n1. It's not straightforward. I'll have to explain it and maybe users won't get it.\n2. Users will not get notified when a new logo is added to vote on.\n\nAny better way to do that?\nPreferably in WordPress, but totally open for other options.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1034765103229864"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1034765103229864"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-11-21T00:11:56+0000","updated_time":"2015-11-21T23:28:13+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1252478278163674","name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din"},{"id":"10208686164891220","name":"Ahmed Rawaf"},{"id":"1488740484494246","name":"Ali Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTI1MjQ3ODI3ODE2MzY3NAZDZD","after":"MTQ4ODc0MDQ4NDQ5NDI0NgZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-11-21T00:59:52+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Fouad","id":"10154777096910845"},"message":"put it on Freelancer.com and 99Designs they have exactly these contests:\n1- you set a budget\n2- contestants from all over the world submit designs\n3- you post a voting link on your blog or social media\n4- your followers go and vote for the best design\n5- the winning design gets rewarded the contest","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1034775896562118"},{"created_time":"2015-11-21T01:03:14+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammad Fouad","id":"10154777096910845"},"message":"here is an example, I guess 99Designs is better but it requires higher budget.\nhttp://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-punchy-logo-company-producing-degree-videos-566270","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1034776996562008"},{"created_time":"2015-11-21T01:52:14+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"Thanks a lot.\nThis is for a user group not a company.
