I usually use white/natural noise generators - surprisingly effective at blocking out surrounding noise. There's an android app (from Relaxio I think) that has presets for rain, thunderstorms, distant traffic, .. etc. with separate volume controls so you can \"mix\". And there are plenty of websites and youtube listings for similar stuff also.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410194839020220"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T18:01:14+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mahmoud","id":"1360592964014097"},"message":"Thank you so much for you reply, but unfortunately I tried that as well, and it didn't work with me :(","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410197332353304"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T18:02:54+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Tantawy","id":"10155099548114764"},"message":"If you mean that your problem is not only about blocking audio noise, but you may also need to block visual noise then may be try to get a big screen, or change your office so that you are looking away from people, may be look at a blocked view like a wall or a distant view like a window.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410199502353087"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T18:05:28+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mahmoud","id":"1360592964014097"},"message":"I can deal with visual noise, but the real problem with the sounds, everyone is talking and discussing, either with client or with an employee","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410201002352937"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T18:06:19+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mahmoud","id":"1360592964014097"},"message":"Also I can't move, as I don't have laptop at work","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410201572352880"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T18:12:09+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Salah","id":"181015452391014"},"message":"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410208839018820"},{"created_time":"2017-03-05T18:12:45+0000","from":{"name":"Gihan Mahmoud","id":"10158238854485591"},"message":"Have you tried noise cancellation headphones?
