way that I've been using all the time is TO AVOID MAKING THE EXTRA CALLS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nthis will improve the overall responsiveness of your code, and will lower the headache from your servers as well.\nhere is what I recommend you to do:\n1- Create a flag called 'callIsInProgress' \" var callIsInProgress = false\"\n2- Wrap your logic inside an IF statement checking if this flage is false. \nif(! callIsInProgress)\n{\n// your code\n}\n\n3- Before moving into your code, set this flag to \"true\"\n4- Do your work (and do it nicely) :)\n5- Inside the callback method, get the response, do your stuff, then reset this flag to \"false\" again, so you can handle any future calls.\n6- Ed3eely
