Of course you all know the name and some of you have tried it, but I do urge the ones who haven't to download it and try the adblocker, not a single add in youtube, actually only one inline showed up, unlike chrome which shows me the same ad every time I refresh, not a single pop up and a much cleaner, snappier browsing experience.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1160351137337926"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1160351137337926"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-06-11T17:53:01+0000","updated_time":"2016-06-16T07:31:01+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1285105998248677","name":"Ahmed Badawy"},{"id":"1652191298131673","name":"Mohammed Yassin"},{"id":"10154961996846145","name":"Karim Shalaby"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTI4NTEwNTk5ODI0ODY3NwZDZD","after":"MTAxNTQ5NjE5OTY4NDYxNDUZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-06-11T18:00:26+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"I have never stolen anything, don't like the tone or the accusation or the attitude.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1160353464004360"},{"created_time":"2016-06-11T18:03:05+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":":D It is my browser, it is my connection, I can totally decide what bytes make it to my screen and what can't.
