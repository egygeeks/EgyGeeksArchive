If there are better ones, kindly drop them in a comment down below. Also I'd like to ask if we're taking c++ in the first semester (for example) should I pre-study c++ or go for another programming language instead?

In your first year, you will study 'Computer Technology' in the first semester, it will include a portion about the C programming language. I suggest you learn JavaScript of any other 'scripting language' first as they will not be very intimidating to learn. You can find a very good JavaScript interactive course at Codecademy.com. If you have the time, learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript all together (all from Codecademy). \nIf you want to learn C/C++, I suggest learning C from the book written by the founders of C, it is called 'The C Programming Language' by K&R. for C++ I suggest waiting till you grasp C first at college then proceed to learn it. \nGood Luck!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"986899198016455"},{"created_time":"2015-08-08T16:02:06+0000","from":{"name":"Samuel A.

Beware, Java and JavaScript are completely different in functionality (Java is not JavaScript and vice versa). \nWhen you proceed with your Java course at college, you can then start to learn C/C++, they share a quite large amount of similarities.\nThe most important thing to know is that you DON'T have to know every little detail about a programming language in order to master it. Actually caring about those small details might be overwhelming and prevent you from mastering it. Eventually, you will know about them, just do not rush things or try to learn everything at once.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"986903631349345"},{"created_time":"2015-08-08T16:21:47+0000","from":{"name":"Abdelrahman Mounir","id":"10156001976483569"},"message":"Yes i'm well aware of the difference between Java and JavaScript, I'm not quite sure when will I be taking Java in college but I'm taking courses to get a head start.
