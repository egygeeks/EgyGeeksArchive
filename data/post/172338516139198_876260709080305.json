I worked on a lot of projects including the web platform for Concerned Joe and I released an opensource version of the whole thing. We self-fund ourselves by freelancing on oDesk.\n\nI got an internship at eSpace last July and right now I'm working on the project we were working on then. It's an iOS game made using Swift. It's also a clone of another game I created earlier using ActionScript 3 during NewGrounds Game Jam 9.\n\nThere are a lot of other stuff to add but I'd rather keep it short. So yea, who'd like to AMA?","message_tags":{"106":[{"id":"429058180465900","name":"UnliCrea","type":"page","offset":106,"length":8}],"349":[{"id":"49999538909","name":"eSpace","type":"page","offset":349,"length":6}]},"actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/876260709080305"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/876260709080305"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-01-06T19:50:05+0000","updated_time":"2015-01-07T12:58:57+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1331560720236182","name":"Mohamed El Shaer"},{"id":"10212320269384425","name":"Ahmed Bolica"},{"id":"10155071713202292","name":"Hassan Aly Selim"},{"id":"10154965677956341","name":"Mohammad Tayseer"},{"id":"10155096840402220","name":"Mostafa Abdellatif Elgayar"},{"id":"1504724176225949","name":"Abdallah Elhasany"},{"id":"10158375948495584","name":"Adel K.

The first one was our first project ever, it was a new programming language using artificial intelligence. You would be able to teach your computer and code it by talking to it. We wanted to extend beyond that, where you could teach a robot how to dance for example. The project was already created, and has been up for around 18 years or so.\n\nThe second thing was a flash game where you had to code to pass the levels. There were not so many libraries at that time that could parse code, or let's say that we were not experienced enough to make something that big. It ended up as being too big for us so we just discontinued the project.\n\nAnd then we extended past the point of \"teaching people programming\" when we released CIE Results and started working on big freelancing projects.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"876271065745936"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T20:21:46+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed Ibrahim","id":"10212392395788840"},"message":"Ahmed Raslan","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10158381834070029","length":12,"name":"Ahmed Raslan","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"876272029079173"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T20:22:35+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Do you have any tips for getting big projects on oDesk?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"876272339079142"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T20:35:26+0000","from":{"name":"Amjad Mashaal","id":"10210954655734032"},"message":"Well, just be honest.\n\nOn oDesk everyone's deceiving and everyone's lying and everyone wants money even if it's dirty and stained with dishonesty.

Things get even better when you finish stuff reasonably fast, or well, let's just summarize it in 6 words, \"when you stop being a bastard\". As long as your language is good, your work is clean, your speed is okay, you're not stealing anyone's money, you make sure everything's working, it'll be easy.\n\nAnd don't get bored. Keep applying and you'll get one of the jobs.\n\nAlso, if you're a starter, don't get bloated.

When I was 13 I joined an academy that taught programming. I learned C++ and problem solving there. At the same time I was learning Objective-C because I was crazy enough to think that vimov would accept my application. It took me a year but I learned everything about OOP, thanks to Stanford's CS193p course, and vimov's QA manager, who introduced me to it.\n\nA few months later, around the beginning of 2013, I learned PHP because I wanted to implement CIE Results, and again I was crazy enough to apply for a freelance job. According to the guy, I actually did a job he's been investing in for 2 years, in a couple of weeks, and I had only few months of experience in PHP, if not weeks. I kept going and by the end of the year I was a Startup Weekend Alexandria participant who knows around 8 programming languages.\n\nStarting UnliCrea has another long story but I'd like to mention that the first time I paid for the hosting and the domain I used my \"3edeyya\".\n\nAnd also, again, there's a lot of details missing here, like other internships I applied for and got rejected, or other projects including other programming languages such as that Python-PHP socket I made which used to parse Python code. That was around October 2012. However, if I added everything that would make this comment huge.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"876282262411483"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T21:01:11+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed Ibrahim","id":"10212392395788840"},"message":"Good job msA, I am interested to work with you soon isA.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"876286002411109"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T21:01:45+0000","from":{"name":"Amjad Mashaal","id":"10210954655734032"},"message":"It'd be an honor :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"876286145744428"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T21:34:50+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Whatever you do, don't get cocky","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"876297112409998"},{"created_time":"2015-01-06T21:55:17+0000","from":{"name":"Amjad Mashaal","id":"10210954655734032"},"message":"Honestly it's more difficult than it sounds.
