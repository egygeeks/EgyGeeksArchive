I think Twitter already supports HTTP2 (but I'm not sure).\n- So far, HTTP2 will allow for non-SSL connection. There's a push to make SSL/TLS required for all connection (which I'm in a favor of, I have to say).\n- Main goal seems to be to reduce number of trips between server and client.\nHe put together a PDF with all the details. Check it out. It's not all technical details but also history of HTTP and how we got here.\nhttp://daniel.haxx.se/http2/","caption":"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/762072553832455"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/762072553832455"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-06-10T05:44:10+0000","updated_time":"2014-06-10T21:11:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"519692291","name":"Hassan Aly Selim"},{"id":"1246823411","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},{"id":"100001614643730","name":"Mina Montaser Youssef"},{"id":"1297892371","name":"Karim Mostafa"},{"id":"521376335","name":"Amr Ali Tealeb"},{"id":"1490973882","name":"Ahmed Moosa"},{"id":"100000224131120","name":"Moutaz Shams"},{"id":"674670940","name":"Ahmed Samir"},{"id":"719470447","name":"Sameh Samir"},{"id":"1614120164","name":"Eslam Hamouda"},{"id":"100001605461050","name":"Ahmed Saleh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNjA1NDYxMDUw","before":"NTE5NjkyMjkx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"762075343832176","from":{"id":"740765313","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"},"message":"HTTP in Binary, they should at least change the name :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-10T05:56:57+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"762181463821564","from":{"id":"552525943","name":"Tarek Amr"},"message":"HTTP in Binary :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-10T12:03:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"762277200478657","from":{"id":"652024918","name":"Amr Eldib"},"message":"From the document, page 14:\n\"http2 is a binary protocol.\nLet that sink in for a minute. If you're a person that's been involved in internet protocols before, chances are that you react strongly with instinct against this and prepare your refute arguments to spell out how useful it is with protocols that are made with text/ascii and that you've done HTTP 1.1 requests numerous times by telnetting to servers and\nentered the requests by hand.\nhttp2 is binary to make the framing much easier. Figuring out the start and the end of frames is one of the really complicated things in HTTP 1.1 and actually in text based protocols in general. By moving away from optional white spaces and different ways to write the same thing, implementations become simpler.\nAlso, it makes it much easier to separate the actual protocol parts from the framing -which in HTTP1 is confusingly intermixed.\"\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure what effect it has to make HTTP binary. Won't I still be able to see the content sent and received?\nWhat are the side effects?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-10T16:13:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"762366967136347","from":{"id":"100000116116716","name":"Mohamed Sameeh Sharaf"},"message":"HBTP :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-10T19:38:01+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"762381643801546","from":{"id":"1246823411","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},"message":"yeah, Hyper Binary Transfer Protocol :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-06-10T20:00:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"762404957132548","from":{"id":"652024918","name":"Amr Eldib"},"message":"You guys know that the Text in HTTP refers to the documents not that it's made of text; Hyper Text rather than regular Text.
