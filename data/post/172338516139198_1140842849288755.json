Problem with companies like Lenovo that if you have a problem and tried to contact customer support, you would be in royal pain being thrown between them, microsoft, your local dealer, etc.\n\n3- You still can install windows natively and have dual boot, while in the other way around, you can only install Mac OS using hackintosh which is basically a non-supported hack that could create a lot of problems specially if you are trying to build something for iOS or Mac Store\n\n4- Your laptop would pretty much be the same after 3-4 years of heavy usage. With most of other brands, they tend to disintegrate for a no given reason (lost keys, broken plastic, etc.)\n\n5- Macbooks have a great reselling value even if you sell them after a decade, while all other brands are pretty much worthless once you use them for just few months.\n\nI have been using Macs since 2006 and never looked back.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1141175729255467"},{"created_time":"2016-05-11T01:53:17+0000","from":{"name":"Ashraf Saleh","id":"1813215512029382"},"message":"If you are getting the y700 make sure you get the model with Intel wireless card.
