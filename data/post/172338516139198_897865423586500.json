As for offline versions on an inventory system, you would use a windows application or even GTK for that, not a web application for sure. In ERP systems it is important to take advantage of client processing power and a 3-tier approach makes a lot of sense.  As for MVC, I really see no need to use that unless you like the pattern or there is a specific need that warrants its use, which is pretty rare. In terms of GMAIL, Google maps and FB, they are just that, no one wants there ERP experience to be anything like that and it is never worth the time or investment or even considered an enhancement, they would rather have more fine grained control over the financial tree.
