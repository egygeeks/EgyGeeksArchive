The documentary shows how MIT staff wrote their programs and how they built compact small machines that wasn't possible at this time.\n\nThere is a lot of interviews with software developers who worked on the mission and a lot of interesting information for us as programmers. During the landing process they had an error with the code 1202. It was the code for the overflow error. Normally it should've crashed but thanks to an engineer who built a revolutionary operating system at this time that allowed the computer to dump less important tasks and operations in favor for the important stuff.\n\nThis is a documentary that is worth every minute of your time to watch. Enjoy it.","story":"Ahmad Alfy shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154097389365670","name":"Ahmad Alfy","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"39":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":39,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBEU9Vp6eR36T01&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fs2.dmcdn.net%2FBLkYi%2F526x297--ao.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQA4lOB3A7txx_Qa","link":"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxxiij_moon-machines-2008-part-3-the-navigation-computer_tech","source":"http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xxxiij?autoplay=1","name":"Moon Machines (2008) Part 3: The Navigation Computer - Video Dailymotion","caption":"dailymotion.com","description":"The third episode details the story of MIT's work on the Apollo Guidance Computer.","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1131028716936835"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1131028716936835"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"video","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2016-04-24T20:06:35+0000","updated_time":"2016-04-25T16:44:26+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10210813166676785","name":"Ahmed Abdelaziz"},{"id":"1255225231180285","name":"Mohamed Yahya"},{"id":"10158142026600408","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad"},{"id":"1415115238511081","name":"Adel Ewis"},{"id":"10155218475063159","name":"Ahmed Abouraya"},{"id":"10154444669171313","name":"Ahmed Mozaly"},{"id":"10155099548114764","name":"Mahmoud Tantawy"},{"id":"10155060165569919","name":"Mohamed El Kerdany"},{"id":"10158480382055085","name":"Karim Tarek"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTA4MTMxNjY2NzY3ODUZD","after":"MTAxNTg0ODAzODIwNTUwODUZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-04-24T21:29:45+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abouraya","id":"10155218475063159"},"message":"@21:40 the overall memory for the Apollo guidance computer program was 72 KB :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1131064116933295"},{"created_time":"2016-04-24T21:40:30+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad","id":"10158142026600408"},"message":"Whenever I learn something about what they did with such low resources, this bit always comes to my mind:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiVi1sR2rM","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1131067406932966"},{"created_time":"2016-04-24T21:41:00+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad","id":"10158142026600408"},"message":"Also thanks for sharing!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1131067590266281"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV6TVRBMk5ERXhOamt6TXpJNU5Ub3hORFl4TlRNek16ZAzEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV6TVRBMk56VTVNREkyTmpJNE1Ub3hORFl4TlRNME1EWXcZD"}}}}
