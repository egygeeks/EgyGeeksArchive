I assume this would require a lot of heavy calculations and this is why people might misuse it.\nRegarding the tables, back in the 90s till mid 2000, CSS wasn't mature enough to be used to create layouts. CSS floats were not fully understood and people were using tables to create layouts taking the advantage of the \"border=0\" attribute. People who created websites back in the early 2000s knows that horror :D People started using CSS layouts after Jeffrey Zeldman wrote his famous book \"Designing with web standards\", after that everything changed.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"1252844501489402","length":13,"name":"Mohamed Samir","offset":0,"type":"user"},{"id":"134210489980696","length":15,"name":"Jeffrey Zeldman","offset":598,"type":"page"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"912392282133814"},{"created_time":"2015-03-20T13:04:28+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samir","id":"1252844501489402"},"message":"Well well, thanks Ahmad, now I know I was among misusers :D\nLike we needed more of calculation to get things done :'(\nI will misuse it, AGAIN :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154097389365670","length":5,"name":"Ahmad Alfy","offset":18,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"912396565466719"},{"created_time":"2015-03-20T15:20:42+0000","from":{"name":"Amr Ismail Gawish","id":"10158251587420212"},"message":"It's amazing how index in css starts with 1 not 0!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"912449792128063"},{"created_time":"2015-03-21T18:22:26+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abdurrahman","id":"1394376843970680"},"message":"Amr AbuMuslim","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10210309758573088","length":13,"name":"Amr AbuMuslim","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"912970932075949"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVEV5TXpnek56YzRPREF4TXpNeE9qRTBNalk0TlRRek9EQT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVEV5T1Rjd09UTXlNRGMxT1RRNU9qRTBNalk1TmpJeE5EWT0ZD"}}}}
