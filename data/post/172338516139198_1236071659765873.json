This DBMS allows only one single write*operating to take place at any given time, hence allowing a limited throughput.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen To Use PostgreSQL\n\nData integrity:\nWhen reliability and data integrity are an absolute necessity without excuses, PostgreSQL is the better choice.\n\nComplex, custom procedures:\nIf you require your database to perform custom procedures, PostgreSQL, being extensible, is the better choice.\n\nIntegration:\nIn the future, if there is a chance of necessity arising for migrating the entire database system to a propriety (e.g. Oracle) solution, PostgreSQL will be the most compliant and easy to handle base for the switch.\n\nComplex designs:\nCompared to other open-source and free RDBMS implementations, for complex database designs, PostgreSQL offers the most in terms of functionality and possibilities without giving up on other valuable assets.\n\nWhen Not To Use PostgreSQL\n\nSpeed:\nIf all you require is fast read operations, PostgreSQL is not the tool to go for.\n\nSimple set ups:\nUnless you require absolute data integrity, ACID compliance or complex designs, PostgreSQL can be an over-kill for simple set-ups.\n\nReplication:\nUnless you are willing to spend the time, energy and resources, achieving replication with MySQL might be simpler for those who lack the database and system administration experience.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen To Use MySQL\n\nDistributed operations:\nWhen you need more than what SQLite can offer, including MySQL to your deployment stack, just like any stand-alone database server, brings a lot of operational freedom together with some advanced features.\n\nHigh security:\nMySQL's security features provide reliable protection for data-access (and use) in a simple way.\n\nWeb-sites and web-applications:\nA great majority of web-sites (and web-applications) can simply work on MySQL despite the constraints. This flexible and somewhat scalable tool is easy to use and easy to manage -- which proves very helpful in the long run.\n\nCustom solutions:\nIf you are working on a highly specific and extremely custom solution, MySQL can tag along easily and go by your rules thanks to its rich configuration settings and operation modes.\n\nWhen Not To Use MySQL\n\nSQL compliance:\nSince MySQL does not [try to] implement the full SQL standard, this tool is not completely SQL compliant. If you might need integration with such RDBMSs, switching from MySQL will not be easy.\n\nConcurrency:\nEven though MySQL and some storage engines perform really well with read operations, concurrent read-writes can be problematic.\n\nLack of features:\nAgain, depending on the choice of the database-engine, MySQL can lack certain features, such as the full-text search.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nto read the full article visit: \n","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1236071659765873"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1236071659765873"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","created_time":"2016-09-19T12:34:55+0000","updated_time":"2016-09-21T01:58:03+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154911551735619","name":"Hassan Sultan"},{"id":"1260256337402340","name":"Ibrahim Eid"},{"id":"1567728269922892","name":"Muhamad Eissa"},{"id":"10210277573008432","name":"Eslam Hamouda"},{"id":"1285105998248677","name":"Ahmed Badawy"},{"id":"1468423219844248","name":"Mohamed Amin"},{"id":"1915974811972005","name":"Muhammad Okasha"},{"id":"827049870776926","name":"Ahmed Mohamed Abd El-Hamid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTQ5MTE1NTE3MzU2MTkZD","after":"ODI3MDQ5ODcwNzc2OTI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-09-19T13:34:35+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Okasha","id":"1915974811972005"},"message":"طيب يا بشمهندس لو واحد زييى مبيحسش بالفروق دى وبالذات لانى مثلا بستخدم مع Django PostreSQL دايما على العكس لما كنت بستخدم MySQL مع ال PHP وغيرها انا مش بخس بالفرق - بس شايف من كلامك ان ال MySQL فيها ميزات افضل","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1236102483096124"},{"created_time":"2016-09-21T01:57:58+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Hossam","id":"1078275502276250"},"message":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PoFIohBSM4","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1237360009637038"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEl6TmpFd01qUTRNekE1TmpFeU5Eb3hORGMwTWpreU1EYzEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEl6TnpNMk1EQXdPVFl6TnpBek9Eb3hORGMwTkRJek1EYzUZD"}}}}
