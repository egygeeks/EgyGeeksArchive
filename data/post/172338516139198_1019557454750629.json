Serving C10M is a different story.\nErlang stacks running on bare metal can quite easily do μs.\n\nIt'll also be helpful to discuss where the sink hole was, going from 300ms to 8ms is a ~97% improvement, so where in your stack was the bulk of that 300ms being spent? Also is this an end-to-end average per request or the average is measured just after your reverse proxy (if you're using one) hands over the request to your web app's process, in such case you should clarify this.\n\nAll in all, I'm sure it's an accomplishment so congrats for that but such a high % change is a pipe dream for a system handling millions of requests per minute. So without any proper context and background insights into the website's operational nature and the stack it's running on, it's hard to truly appreciate the level of improvement stated which is unfair to you.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1019597268079981"},{"created_time":"2015-10-14T20:27:13+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mozaly","id":"10154444669171313"},"message":"Hi Hady,\n* the \"some website\" is a one with 8 digits requests per month\n\n* the stack is ASP.NET MVC\n\n* the new revamp is almost ready but the numbers is tested with the same context of the live one\n\n* the 97% improvement reached after changing the flow of the data to a \"nearly\" one way direction, the custom in-memory caching engine and the background workers behind, are doing the hard work\n\n* this is an end-to-end SERVER response time measure, the 8 ms is not the new average YET, as I said, we just unlocked this level today (current average is about 20)","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1019613011411740"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF4T1RVMk1qa3lORGMxTURBNE1qb3hORFEwT0RRMk1EVTQZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF4T1RZAeE16QXhNVFF4TVRjME1Eb3hORFEwT0RVME5ETTAZD"}}}}
