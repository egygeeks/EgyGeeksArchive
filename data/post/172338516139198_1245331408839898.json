The latest system's data throughput was > 3.2 GB/s. So, we were no longer able to acquire to SSDs without the software crashing* because their throughput is an order of magnitude less. \n\nI ended up turning off file caching and buffering** in the win32 file IO API, taking up ~35 gigs of RAM and setting them up as RAMdisk. I would stream to RAM this way, and then copy to disk after the fact. This setup limits the imaging session to ~ 10 seconds. The next step I'm taking is splitting the data writes over 2 PCIe SSDs. \n\nIs there anything I could do differently to handle this kind of throughput more efficiently? Do you perhaps know of some lossless compression algorithm that is fast enough? Something else?\n\n* Crashing is because of the buffer overflows in the acquisition card and because the software sucks.\n** If you ever want to do this, make sure that all the buffers you want to write to a file are page aligned. VirtualAlloc() lets you allocate page-aligned memory.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1245331408839898"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1245331408839898"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-09-30T04:17:46+0000","updated_time":"2016-10-02T17:18:45+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-09-30T09:27:00+0000","from":{"name":"Tony Raoul Iscaros","id":"10155085965723420"},"message":"Can't you subdivided the system to multiple nodes ?\nCan you add a GPU to the system ?
