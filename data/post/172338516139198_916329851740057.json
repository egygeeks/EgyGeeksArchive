The paper that sparked all research in brain-machine interfaces:\n\n\"Real-time control of a robot arm using simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex \" \n\nChapin et al.,\n\nTL;DR: This is the first published effort to record neuronal activity and use it to electronically drive actuators in a robot-arm. The implications at the time were that this could lead to prostheses that are directly controlled by the brain, and \"feel natural\". There's still *a lot* to be done in that area, but things like feedback and bi-directional interfaces have already been demonstrated. Meaning, there are now research prosthetic arms with which humans can \"feel\" things like touch and finger/palm formation. Things which we take for-granted, but are actually critical.\n\nhttps://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490i/07wi/papers/paper011.pdf\n\nEDIT: In case you're *really* interested, this review article, though somewhat dated (2006), does a decent job at giving an overview of BMIs:\n\nhttps://cs.rochester.edu/~kautz/Courses/290Bspring2008/NeuroRobots/TiNS_2006.pdf","story":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10158142026600408","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}],"52":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":52,"length":14}]},"link":"https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490i/07wi/papers/paper011.pdf","name":"courses.cs.washington.edu","caption":"courses.cs.washington.edu","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/916329851740057"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/916329851740057"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2015-03-28T19:00:24+0000","updated_time":"2015-03-28T20:39:16+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1647326241951498","name":"Moutaz Shams"},{"id":"10154097389365670","name":"Ahmad Alfy"},{"id":"1766716286975105","name":"Ahmad A.
