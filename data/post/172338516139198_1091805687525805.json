I am looking for a solution that makes a central repository and simple to use.\nEdit: forgot to add to be secure too :D\nThank you.","story":"Ahmad Alfy shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154097389365670","name":"Ahmad Alfy","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"39":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":39,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCA5QX64HPLo3ak&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sstatic.net%2Fsecurity%2Fimg%2Fapple-touch-icon%402.png%3Fv%3D497726d850f9%26a&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQBksCaruyc35ZJq","link":"http://security.stackexchange.com/","name":"Information Security Stack Exchange","caption":"security.stackexchange.com","description":"Q&A for information security professionals","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1091805687525805"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1091805687525805"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2016-03-05T11:41:41+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-05T15:01:25+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1762823740701312","name":"Ashraf Elalfy"},{"id":"599781276899213","name":"Mostafa Hussein"},{"id":"1118459391596579","name":"Mohamad Emad"},{"id":"715713385273130","name":"Ahmad Magdy"},{"id":"1481891938521689","name":"Ahmed Ateek"},{"id":"10211847388241825","name":"Ahmed Shawky"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTc2MjgyMzc0MDcwMTMxMgZDZD","after":"MTAyMTE4NDczODgyNDE4MjUZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-03-05T11:54:56+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shawky","id":"10211847388241825"},"message":"please check this . its good option https://lastpass.com/how-it-works/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1091808974192143"},{"created_time":"2016-03-05T12:06:24+0000","from":{"name":"Hassan Ibraheem","id":"10156033879973228"},"message":"I use keepassx.
