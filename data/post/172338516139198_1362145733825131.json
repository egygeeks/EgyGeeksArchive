If you want to close one you may want to close the other: \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8678441/difference-between-wscript-and-cscript\n\nNow to answer your question:\n-If you're just a home user who mainly browses the internet, you maybe able to get away with removing them (though I would suggest just renaming them) and not regretting it. \n-If you are anything more, be very careful. VB scripts are used to automate configuration tasks in Windows, not just by IT admins. Setup scripts for software development tools or things you want to configure may be written in VBS. \n\nDeleting WScript or SCript to prevent virus infections is like deleting powershell to prevent the same issue... You're stripping away a core system component that is used by many applications in hope that it closes a surface of attack.\n\nFrom a security perspective, what you are suggesting actually makes the most sense on servers where you absolutely control the image and what it can do. This is why Azure (and other cloud computing providers) will give you server images that are stripped down of most things that come with the OS to keep it slim and reduce unnecessary churn on the processors as well as security surface attack area.\n\nBut for a home PC, deleting WScript is like turning down the Air Conditioner because it's cold when the front door is wide open. It is nothing compared to keeping the browser in the OS. :) The end user will happily click yes to things that are so much worse than a VB script.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1362568623782842"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0yTWpNeU9EVXdOekUwTURFNE56b3hORGcxTVRFNE56RTUZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0yTWpVMk9EWXlNemM0TWpnME1qb3hORGcxTVRNNE5EWTEZD"}}}}
