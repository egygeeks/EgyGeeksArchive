{"id":"172338516139198_853465064693203","from":{"name":"Mohammad Alaggan","id":"10154136920322085"},"message":"There has been internal conflict between Debian developers, appears to be between those who support freedom of choice even at the cost of some advantages, and those who support better performance and usability at the cost of bloated system that is difficult to modify freely (what is referred to as \"lock-in\" in the article). The bloat comes from adopting systemd instead of sysvinit, apparently. Debian is significant because it is one of the most widely-spread distributions and the base of many other distributions, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.\n\nAfter lots of mediation efforts failed, Debian is finally going to be forked. The freedom-supporting fork will be called Devuan.\n\nAlthough this is not about technical aspects, it is about policy, and about the philosophy of free software and the role of civil society in protecting ideals.","story":"Mohammad Alaggan shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154136920322085","name":"Mohammad Alaggan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16}],"45":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":45,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQARzJ07d_xFuh_Z&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyne.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F11%2Focchiello_sponsor1.png&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAPUWalW3feZqP_","link":"https://lists.dyne.org/lurker/message/20141127.212941.f55acc3a.en.html","name":"[Dng] [debianfork] Don't panic and keep forking Debianâ„¢!","caption":"lists.dyne.org","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/853465064693203"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/853465064693203"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2014-11-29T11:24:01+0000","updated_time":"2014-11-29T12:13:29+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10158142026600408","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad"},{"id":"10154838763611066","name":"Shady M.
