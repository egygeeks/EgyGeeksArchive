In the latter case, PayPal does the conversion for a fee of about 3.66%. That's almost the same as what the Egyptian banks charge now after the latest changes (3.5%, previously was 2.5%).\n\nThere are two good things about doing this:\n1) You pay in EGP, so you're not subject to any limitations by the CBE on foreign currency payments.\n2) PayPal does the conversion, relieving the Egyptian economy from availing the foreign currency.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with PayPal and I'm not trying to promote their service, but rather trying to help solve our problem.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1090053764367664"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1090053764367664"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-03-02T09:52:56+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-03T04:44:03+0000","shares":{"count":13},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154121075511012","name":"Mostafa Mohsen Gaafar"},{"id":"10154516136372104","name":"ElMohanned Ahmed"},{"id":"10154118701696184","name":"Ahmed Salem"},{"id":"1317342155017349","name":"Ahmed Elsayed Shahawi"},{"id":"10208892878536227","name":"Sameh Manaa"},{"id":"1415115238511081","name":"Adel Ewis"},{"id":"1851508841788910","name":"Ahmed Essam"},{"id":"1442706032414674","name":"Islam Abolfotouh"},{"id":"10154171754791793","name":"Sherif Medhat"},{"id":"10154763290933941","name":"Abdelrahman Y.
