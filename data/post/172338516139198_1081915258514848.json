He's just published a blog post about the entire infrastructure behind StackOverflow the 2016 edition.\nHe mentioned earlier and I'm quoting him \"One of the reasons I love working at Stack Overflow is we’re encouraged to talk about almost anything out in the open. Except for things companies always keep private like financials and the nuclear launch codes, everything else is fair game.\". Usually he posts on Twitter screenshot from their database monitoring server containing table names, row counts and sizes. This approach is very nice. Also the fact that StackOverflow is served from only 11 webservers is awesome!\nFollow this guy and his blog. This post is a first in a series. \nhttps://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1081915258514848"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1081915258514848"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-02-17T22:02:31+0000","updated_time":"2016-02-17T23:01:55+0000","shares":{"count":1},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10211954222794711","name":"Ahmed Abdul Fatah"},{"id":"10154294832366835","name":"Mahmoud Atef"},{"id":"1367909089896796","name":"Ahmed El Mowafy"},{"id":"1851508841788910","name":"Ahmed Essam"},{"id":"10154571159919542","name":"Ahmed Sadek"},{"id":"10155099548114764","name":"Mahmoud Tantawy"},{"id":"10154884040390170","name":"Mohammed El Sayed"},{"id":"10211811206896077","name":"Abdelrady Fcis"},{"id":"10158420098420077","name":"Hatem Maamoun"},{"id":"10154094819176486","name":"Ibrahim Hammad"},{"id":"10155206502385921","name":"Ashraf Kaabi"},{"id":"1348336588561390","name":"Hosam Aly"},{"id":"1260256337402340","name":"Ibrahim Eid"},{"id":"10158274819655058","name":"Ahmad Hisham"},{"id":"10155071713202292","name":"Hassan Aly Selim"},{"id":"10158224231920062","name":"Omar Sherif"},{"id":"10155190776529497","name":"Ahmed Hassan"},{"id":"1666163166733719","name":"ابراهيم محمد"},{"id":"10155080508766171","name":"Hisham Abd El-Hafez Eid"},{"id":"10158257495930262","name":"Karim Alweheshy"},{"id":"10154876688426014","name":"Islam Azab"},{"id":"10154434352503657","name":"Ahmed Ibrahim Khalil"},{"id":"10154310824515849","name":"Muhammad Atef"},{"id":"10154237114042750","name":"Moaz El-Nashar"},{"id":"10154511379887689","name":"Mohammed Farghal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTE5NTQyMjI3OTQ3MTEZD","after":"MTAxNTQ1MTEzNzk4ODc2ODkZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-02-17T22:11:53+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Ibrahim Khalil","id":"10154434352503657"},"message":"There is much more info hanging in this Reddit thread, I think you will love it in case you haven't seen it before.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/468p2m/stack_overflow_the_architecture_2016_edition/","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1081918501847857"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEE0TVRreE9EVXdNVGcwTnpnMU56b3hORFUxTnpRM01URTAZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEE0TVRreE9EVXdNVGcwTnpnMU56b3hORFUxTnpRM01URTAZD"}}}}
