Per the help center:\nBe careful, because the community frowns on overt self-promotion and tends to vote it down and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, so be it. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers. Also, if a huge percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details.\nAny type of \"astroturfing\" promotion is not acceptable. It brings down the overall value of genuine recommendations for everyone on the site.\nIf you can stay within the above guidelines, and offer questions and answers of genuine benefit to the community which happen to mention your affiliation or product in context -- and with full disclosure -- then your future contributions are welcome.\nRegards,\nAndrew Barber\nStack Overflow moderator","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"873079922731717"},{"created_time":"2015-01-02T22:19:08+0000","from":{"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","id":"10210243495897310"},"message":"i think that i've been blocked for sharing snippets from my github account!!!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"873080146065028"},{"created_time":"2015-01-02T22:49:34+0000","from":{"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","id":"10210243495897310"},"message":"it's a no reply mail they're just informing","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"873090912730618"},{"created_time":"2015-01-02T23:53:26+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"Alaa Attya Mohamed Yep and they answer very quickly than Usual :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10210243495897310","length":18,"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"873110926061950"},{"created_time":"2015-01-02T23:55:04+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"Alaa Attya Mohamed Reply them that helping users with gists it's not an issue and it's not promoting anything.
