This one is tough, but you are not expected to get a full score, they are rather testing your \"problem solving abilities\".\n\n3- The next step is an online interview, through which they will review your test result and require you to solve two more problems with them over-watching/discussing it with you.\n\n4- The final step is an assignment, usually one week long (two if it is specially hard). The assignment differs according to how you define your expected position (frontend, backend, mobile, etc.). This assignment will be heavily inspected for design and code style.\n\n5- After that, congratulation, you are one of the best 3% developers in the word, as per Toptal advertisement :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154884040385170","length":7,"name":"Meligy","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"974523805920661"},{"created_time":"2015-07-19T02:14:19+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"Aha.
