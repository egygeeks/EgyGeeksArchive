How Egyptian software companies charge clients ? Do we consider Dollar price into out calculations ? Is there any other way of determining the cost of software ?\n\nAnother question, \nFor a fresh graduate software engineer in Egypt how can I decide if I'm being offered a fair salary when I cant find such available statistics?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1400056860034018"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1400056860034018"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-02-25T03:27:43+0000","updated_time":"2017-02-25T15:44:53+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1417211125005592","name":"Mostafa Elsayh"},{"id":"10206388749157089","name":"Walid Osama"},{"id":"1200777176707152","name":"Ahmad Dawoud"},{"id":"342947436105550","name":"Muhammed Nagy"},{"id":"1231245263656767","name":"Sherif Abdel-Naby"},{"id":"10211460236408789","name":"Emad Moheb"},{"id":"2076677375897116","name":"Ahmed Emad"},{"id":"10210283493056726","name":"Ramy Farid"},{"id":"1300191916693652","name":"Hossam Hassan"},{"id":"10154374517206444","name":"Rofael Emil Fayez Behnam"},{"id":"10155098857034860","name":"Omar Essam"},{"id":"10154099730567024","name":"Mohammed Hussien"},{"id":"1270659729686465","name":"Menem Salama"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTQxNzIxMTEyNTAwNTU5MgZDZD","after":"MTI3MDY1OTcyOTY4NjQ2NQZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-02-25T06:01:08+0000","from":{"name":"Youssef Mohamed","id":"10212595704671268"},"message":"I think u can't compare freelancing websites to us for some reasons .. the most important is that people offering jobs there from western countries will probably use their websites in an environment where the profits will be higher, by the same ratio, than the profits made by Egyptian startups and companies .. so for example a way to compare can be the minimum wage in US vs the average salary of regular junior developer in US against the Egyptian minimum wage to predict the Egyptian average salary ..

That could be hiring full time employee, or contracting a company for a fixed price with set deliverables. \n\nAs for the person doing the work, i think accepting an offer that is simply an hourly rate of a full time job is the worst thing they can do. Typically a freelancer should either charge you a price that is near your other offers (if we are talking about a fixed budget), or it should be an the hourly rate of a full time salary TIMES a factor (minimum 1.5). The employer can't pay the lower cost of a full time salary rate without the full time employment commitment. It's simply not fair. The freelance developer doesn't have the job security a fulltime job offers, yet can offer you a lower cost and more flexibility. \n\nWhat really matters here is their ability to deliver quality work that would have cost you multiple times more had you hired a company. Depending on what you want and their portfolio, either options could be better.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1400180963354941"},{"created_time":"2017-02-25T07:50:32+0000","from":{"name":"Ramy Farid","id":"10210283493056726"},"message":"As far as I know a lot of Egyptian startups are actually doing their business for foreign clients which pay them in USD or Euro and those startups will still pay you in Egyptian currency and maybe even far below the decent average of a software engineer because why not, you know","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1400235916682779"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF3TURFMU9UWTRNREF5TXpjek5qb3hORGc0TURBeU5EWTUZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF3TURJek5Ua3hOalk0TWpjM09Ub3hORGc0TURBNU1ETXkZD"}}}}
