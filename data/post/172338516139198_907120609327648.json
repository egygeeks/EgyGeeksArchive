Attribute themselves aren't, like if you tried to style an input with a \"required\" attribute ... If the attribute is uppercase like \"REQUIRED\" you can still select it using input[required] and it will be picked up by the element (check out this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/2rrt00e9/)\n\nTo comply with XHTML standards all your tags, attributes (not talking about values here) should be in lowercase ... As a general rule, any value that's not meant for displaying info (like contents of data attributes if you are depending on its value for instance) is better to be written in lowercase ... This is like a convention a lot of people used to follow ...\n\nAll the talk about using a flag for case-sensitivity in CSS selectors level 4 is pure non-sense .... trash talk, I don't believe there is any need for that. Just because you can add whatever to standards doesn't mean you should. Better push in other directions that are truly needed.\n\n*edit: rephrased a few words and corrected a wrong information.
