I'm running a thing on Windows 10, and according to Docs, the version I use (AbcPDF 9) supports IE11.\n\nBut some styles (only few of them) are not applied. I could spot a case where things like \":not(.some-class)\" isn't working, although it's working in normal page when opened in IE11.\n\nI looked for options, saw Selectivizr, but it seems to do nothing (I think I load it correctly, after jQuery and styles).\n\nMy assumption is that AbcPdf is working in some earlier IE mode or something. Is there any other option that adds the \":not()\" etc selectors to earlier IE?\n\nOr maybe, is there any way I can make sure AbcPDF is using the full capabilities of IE11 installed?\n\nThanks.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1098192610220446"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1098192610220446"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-03-15T00:13:48+0000","updated_time":"2016-03-15T20:04:21+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-03-15T14:30:42+0000","from":{"name":"Bassam Abd Elhamid","id":"1811475205784288"},"message":"لو الموضوع خاص بعرض البى دى اف فى البروزر ففى فكرة عبيطة احب اشارك بيها, ممكن تحول الملف لصور- عند الطلب - وتعرض الصور فى يوزر كونترول ليه نفس مفاتيح البى دى اف فييوار , يرسل للسرفر يعدل فى الصور ويرجعها او يطلب الصفحة الى بعدها او الى قبلها.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1098609380178769"},{"created_time":"2016-03-15T14:54:26+0000","from":{"name":"Hassan Aly Selim","id":"10155071713202292"},"message":"I'm not sure if this is useful in your case or not, but I know that to make sure IE11 uses all it's supported features, you put this in the head:\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1098624810177226"},{"created_time":"2016-03-15T19:44:47+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"I just confirmed that it renders as IE 9 (printed the classes in the conditional comments around the HTML tags), which is crazy because it's running on a Windows 10 machine that only has IE11.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1098816700158037"},{"created_time":"2016-03-15T20:04:20+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"I guess THIS must be related\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153882092600170&set=a.10150382365805170.409044.544815169&type=3\nAnyone with Windows 10 machine can tell me what they get for this?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1098826303490410"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEE1T0RZAd09UTTRNREUzT0RjMk9Ub3hORFU0TURVeU1qUXkZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEE1T0RneU5qTXdNelE1TURReE1Eb3hORFU0TURjeU1qWXcZD"}}}}
