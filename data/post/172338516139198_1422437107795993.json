The only thing that's different is the router itself\nthat i connect my ethernet cable to.\n\nSo is there a specific setting in the router that i should check?\nor is it a compatibility issue (ethernet shields are not compatible with some routers)\nor maybe the shield is faulty?\n\nwhat i have already checked :\n1) No sd card is in the sd slot\n2) DHCP server is enabled in both home network's routers\n3) The 3 LEDs of the ethernet on the shield are on correctly \n4) when i tried the static ip (Ethernet.begin(mac, ip)) it gives out the correct Ethernet.localIP() but when i enter it in the browser it doesn't work","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1422437107795993"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1422437107795993"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-03-16T18:10:04+0000","updated_time":"2017-03-16T18:32:39+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10155099548114764","name":"Mahmoud Tantawy"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTUwOTk1NDgxMTQ3NjQZD","after":"MTAxNTUwOTk1NDgxMTQ3NjQZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-03-16T18:27:34+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Hossam","id":"1078275502276250"},"message":"Have you tried asking there? http://arduino.stackexchange.com/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1422454761127561"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF5TWpRMU5EYzJNVEV5TnpVMk1Ub3hORGc1TmpnNE9EVTIZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF5TWpRMU5EYzJNVEV5TnpVMk1Ub3hORGc1TmpnNE9EVTIZD"}}}}
