It provides market validation. It tells you that people are willing to pay for it.\n\nIf you come up with an idea that no one tried before, it's more likely that others found it bad rather than that you are the first person ever to come up with it.\n\nThat leads me to the opening statement. You'll learn a lot of thing building what the idea is about. It may succeed and you'll learn more, and you might apply the learning to other ideas afterwards.\n\nIt may fail, and then you'll also apply the learning to another idea and try again. You've already learned something about market validation and fear of other ideas by reading these comments.","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"868412149865161"},{"created_time":"2014-12-28T07:01:08+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"+++++1 for Mohamed Meligy Comment.
