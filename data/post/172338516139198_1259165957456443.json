The main reason for that is we actually don't have any CS research universities. Like for example, The University of Berkeley is mostly dedicated to researches while the MIT is balanced between researches and applied CS. The real problem is the lack of fund or grants, I have a cousin who lives in Canada and he once requested a robot worth $50K for researches, and the university (Waterloo btw) had already had this robot in its labs so it gave it to him just like that.\n\nNew programmers should first work in startups where they are most valuable to the company as a whole, also they will be responsible for a lot of tasks since the man power is relatively low. Once they acquired good knowledge (and self-confidence) they can then work in big companies (preferably abroad with the exception of Embedded Hardware/Software companies as they are well established here)","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1259169307456108"},{"created_time":"2016-10-15T23:14:16+0000","from":{"name":"Amr ElAnsary","id":"10158229517600403"},"message":"Amr Nassar","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154979578725185","length":10,"name":"Amr Nassar","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1259174350788937"},{"created_time":"2016-10-15T23:14:48+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"The problem lies in Management Science not Computer Science believe me.

People have been successful in Russia, China who some would argue were oppressive regime and many have failed in freedom homes :) The root cause in my humble opinion is what I wrote above, we forgot who we are, and why we are here, the family has been hacked, moral codes have been breached, we need to fix that first.
