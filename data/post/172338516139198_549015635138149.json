Django is one of many different web frameworks for Python, and it will help you learn more about the power of Python.  \n\nThere are a lot of web frameworks for Python, because it's easy to build your own web framework, but don't try to learn all of them because this will waste your time. I advise you to learn Django well, then you can check other frameworks\n\nYou should start with the Django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/), then work on a medium project & start picking different parts of the framework (caching, ORM, templates, etc). You can check the Django book (http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/index.html), but it doesn't cover the latest versions, so you'll need to go back to Django documentation to learn the newest parts\n\nFinally, please run this command after you install Python, and make sure you understand everything that is written\n\nc:\\> python -c \"import this\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-02T08:36:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQ5MjEwMjYxNzg1MzUz","before":"NTQ5MDE2OTQ4NDcxMzUx"}}}}
