We used to have an auto scaling group of min 1 and max 1 with a relatively high bid price. To use cheaper spot instances instead of those reserved ones :D And yeah, we tolerate some downtime if the instance got killed :D\nYou mentioned that you use cloud-init for bootstrapping new instances and pulling the latest code version, but I would love to know how do you roll out new versions to already running instances. Also, I've never used AWS code deploy before, so I'll be waiting for a post about it :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1161070087266031"},{"created_time":"2016-06-13T00:38:06+0000","from":{"name":"Hossam Saraya","id":"10158512210325389"},"message":"üëèüëè great post ya posten.
