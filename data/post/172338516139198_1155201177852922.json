I manage a few hosting accounts for friends and recently I moved from managed VPS to digitalocean ... Everything is running perfectly except for emails ...\nI did a lot of research ... The options I found was either:\n1- Use a third party service like https://www.mailcheap.co/ ... Seems to fit exactly what I need but it's expensive ($24/mo)\n2- Run my own mail server using Mail-In-A-Box on digitalocean. It will cost nearly $120/yr but I read a lot of articles and discussions on reddit and hosting forums discouraging running your own server. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server.\n3- Use a free service like Zoho mail but it is limited to one domain per account and 10 email addresses per account. I can create multiple accounts but I don't want to do that.\n\nI would like to get your input if you have any experience.","story":"Ahmad Alfy shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154097389365670","name":"Ahmad Alfy","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"39":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":39,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCUo0hhXZXJo25h&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalocean.com%2Fassets%2Fcommunity%2Fdefault_social_sharing-0aa6820971a9245da7cba5a89dc74ac3.png&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDsFrppnlLNs61P","link":"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server","name":"Why You May Not Want To Run Your Own Mail Server | DigitalOcean","caption":"digitalocean.com","description":"When setting up a web site or application under your own domain, it is likely that you will also want a mail server to handle the domain's incoming and outgoing email.

If you can afford it, don't run your own email system. \n\nEmail is a pretty complex system that requires a lot of experience to get things right. It involves a lot of technologies, services, people and just too much moving parts to control easily. \n\nYou can do everything right and just land with an IP with bad reputation on DO and have a shitty delivery rate despite all your work. One of your clients could has his computer owned and you end up with millions of spam emails in your queue and fully broken service. \n\nThat being said, it's an excellent learning opportunity! You will learn a lot! Just try to start with a small system with a very small number of users. Supporting users is a massive pain and it's why all those providers are pretty expensive. \n\nStart small, read a lot and don't make a lot of mistakes to avoid reputation penalties. You can route your outgoing email through services like sendgrid and mandrill in the beginning to avoid losing email.
