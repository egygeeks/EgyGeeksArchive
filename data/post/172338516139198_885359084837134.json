Are you the founder? If so, you need to consider some competitors like www.diigo.com and btw, don't listen to the comment you got on Reddit and think of it as a full fledged business.

My advice is if your idea is simple , go ahead and make a prototype out of it and try to see where it goes .

It wasn't really easy to figure out how to save the page (including the media) as a \"blob\" and send it to the server. Fortunately, that part's done, as a prototype at least. I still don't know how to make it work on every page out there but I believe that isn't a solid wall, it just needs more research.\n\nThe next problem is the highlighting itself. I guess obtaining the text out of the context would be easy, but since we would highlight the text using CSS it would probably mess with the context.\n\nHere's an example to explain.\n\n<div id=\"Div1\">Some div 1 text</div><div id=\"Div2\">Some div 2 text</div>\n\nNow let's consider that the user selected the text from \"1 text\" till \"div 2\". If we're using divs to highlight, then that's how it will end up as.\n\n<div id=\"Div1\">Some div <div id=\"HighlightThat\">1 text</div><div id=\"Div2\">Some div 2</div> text</div>\n\nImagine the mess.\n\nUp till now, that's the part I can't figure out how to solve.
