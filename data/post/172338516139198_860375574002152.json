KarimAllah Ahmed\n\n- Linux Kernel Developer at Amazon Web Services \nSoftware engineer with a decent background in Linux/Unix administration.\n\n- Fluent in several programming languages, and well-versed in several programming paradigms. \n\n- His main areas of expertise are Kernel Design, Virtualization, and Microprocessors.\n\nLinkendin: http://de.linkedin.com/pub/karimallah-ahmed/13/829/550","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/event.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/860375574002152"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/860375574002152"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"event","object_id":"917491081617784","created_time":"2014-12-13T16:33:35+0000","updated_time":"2014-12-13T16:33:35+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1422451614480113","name":"Ahmed Al Jabry"},{"id":"10154379038212957","name":"Emad Elsaid"},{"id":"599781276899213","name":"Mostafa Hussein"},{"id":"10158483817400314","name":"Mohamed Elsherif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTQyMjQ1MTYxNDQ4MDExMwZDZD","after":"MTAxNTg0ODM4MTc0MDAzMTQZD"}}}}
