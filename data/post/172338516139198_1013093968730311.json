Native in such context would usually send someone hurling at a completely different direction.\n\nThat aside, you'd need to ask yourself a few questions. A) how much time do you have? B) how big is your budget?  C) how much experience do you have building e-commerce solutions (shopping carts, shipping & logistics management, billing systems)\n\nE-commerce be it mobile based or web, entails a few things the least of them all is a shopping cart.\n\nDeveloping one that's secure and solid enough for any commercial grade product you intend to build is not an easy task.\n\nYou'll also be worrying too much about payments, that as well is not a walk in the park as most people like to imagine.\n\nI'd suggest you find yourself a library/service for both, offload this hassle and focus on what is it that you're truly building.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1013594712013570"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF4TXpVNU5EY3hNakF4TXpVM01Eb3hORFF6TmpRek1qSTEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF4TXpVNU5EY3hNakF4TXpVM01Eb3hORFF6TmpRek1qSTEZD"}}}}
