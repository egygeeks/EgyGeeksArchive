After that I suggest you keep your saw sharp in your spare time with some Python and do a some algoroithm courses on coursera, and make sure you speak and write english in at least intermeddiate level  (not the c.v. level you write for employers, the real one). Also keep listening to tech podcasts and reading tech journals. in 3 years after a few projects under your belt and some cool new buzzwords, apply for jobs in US and Australian companies and whether you make it or not in the exams keep going to gain more experience until you can work for a foriegn company overseas. Please note the companies here are mainly a weak imitation of what they have overseas. So 2-4 years is more than enough if you focus to make it to the real thing. Also, try to gain an understanding of Agile and working in small teams in an Agile environment.
