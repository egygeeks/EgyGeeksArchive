I need some recommendations for books about architecture in general. Most of the books that I found are old and I guess will be outdated. Web servers, Caching, In-memory stores, Key value stores,  Proxies, Load balancers, Message queues, Sharding and Replication of stores. I'm really interested in this kind of posts : https://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast & http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html . The idea of thinking of and architecturing highly scalable systems and the design patterns used. Maybe what I'm asking for is too much for a single book but at least you got my point. I'd be really thankful if you could recommend some books or even the proper search keywords. Thank you.\nEDIT: The closest to what I'm searching for was \"Service-Oriented design with Ruby and Rails\" ( http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321659368 ) it contains chapters about Load balancing, caching and messaging.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/895775060462203"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/895775060462203"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-02-16T01:05:01+0000","updated_time":"2015-02-18T08:29:05+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1829457323960362","name":"Galal Aly"},{"id":"1666576346978533","name":"Ana Mohamed"},{"id":"10154526340245735","name":"Mahmoud Abou-Eita"},{"id":"10113230069002554","name":"Omar Ibrahim"},{"id":"10154480818375773","name":"آية محفوظ"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTgyOTQ1NzMyMzk2MDM2MgZDZD","after":"MTAxNTQ0ODA4MTgzNzU3NzMZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-02-16T06:15:16+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Zayed","id":"10154251353221034"},"message":"If you really wanna learn about arquitecture there are two books that you have to read and understand : http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420 and http://www.amazon.es/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215 .
