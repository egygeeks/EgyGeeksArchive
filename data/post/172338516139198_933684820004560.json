What you need to actually compare is the page faults because the architecture of RAM caching is totally different between Linux and Windows.\n\nFor example, when you use SQL Server under windows, the server process would be taking almost all your free memory, does this mean that it's actually using that much memory? Short answer is \"NO\", long answer, well, it's very long, but what I can say is that is takes over the entire memory and create a huge memory pool to decrease page faults and memory loading to the minimum.
