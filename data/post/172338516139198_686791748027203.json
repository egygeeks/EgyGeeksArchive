So it wasn't a good start and i wasn't that easy.\n\nI found my self in a position where i must push my skills. BTW they don't use windows at all they use MAC which was also another challenge for me as I was a normal mac user never had the interest to push my skills in using a mac. and i was a loyal windows user :) that was another challenge for me also. You can say I'm a stubborn person which i insist about making something i dream of it days and night and I don't give up till I get it.\n\nNow I'm a Front End Developer I manage most of the projects in our company as an Agency and as a Product company I have a team working with me. My role can change a lot from a project to another sometimes I'm a Backend developer sometimes I'm a front End and sometimes My involvement in a project can be to project manage it. I get involved also in some decisions in the products we do. The person that was always giving bad impressions about me was working under my supervision in the future and he didn't like how the things got changed and he quite (I never treated him as he did). \n\nThe company has a HUGEEEE rule on my learning path and  they were helping me a lot to be the person I am now. and the person i will be in the future. they educated us on a different concept you can be the best programmer in the world but if you don't have a mentality to solve problems before you even start programming most probably you will make a disaster out of the project you are working on. you will not deliver on time and if you did you will have the worst un-maintainable code in this project.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154884040385170","length":14,"name":"Meligy","offset":572,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"686872061352505"},{"created_time":"2014-01-18T07:08:18+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"I will write more details and I would love to make it a topic for the next Egyptian Geeks/Ask a Developer Podcast :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"686872694685775"},{"created_time":"2014-01-18T07:09:45+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Alaa El Din","id":"1252478278163674"},"message":"Mohamed Meligy You have to attend this podcast :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154884040385170","length":14,"name":"Meligy","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"686872928019085"},{"created_time":"2014-01-18T07:40:35+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Elsherif","id":"10158483817400314"},"message":"Sounds like a good topic for a hangout, I think we can do it as early as next Saturday Jan 25th","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"686878681351843"},{"created_time":"2014-01-18T07:44:23+0000","from":{"name":"Moutaz Shams","id":"1647326241951498"},"message":"متخيل ريهام السلهي هي اللي عامله اللقاء معاه على المحور وبتطرده في آخر الحلقة بسبب التطاول على الدوت-نت :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"686879161351795"},{"created_time":"2014-01-18T09:35:30+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"Thanks a lot Mohamed Alaa :)\n\nCan you expand more on the experience itself as well?
