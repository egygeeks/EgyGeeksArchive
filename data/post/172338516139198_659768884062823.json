I basically hate AngularJS because I was rushed in a 3 weeks marathon to create an application for a multinational corp built using AngularJS ... At this time it was buggy as hell and the documentation was horrible ... I had to buy the book written by one of the core developers and had it delivered in less than a week only to start with the basic stuff :( The app I was creating required a lot of work ... The UX guys did an awesome job to be honest but I believe the idea they had in mind was \"Let's torture the front-end developer who's gonna code that ...\" I mean ... inline editing, lot of validation rules, sub-views, push notifications ... Everything was taking A LOT of time to find how to do it properly ... That makes me remember, one of my questions on StackOverflow got me a golden badge today because it was opened more than 10k ... You won't believe what the question was about! It was about how to invoke modal window written in AngularJS directive ... It sounds very easy to do ... but it wasn't :( ... Any way, fast forward the three weeks, I delivered in time after a lot of sleepless nights ...
