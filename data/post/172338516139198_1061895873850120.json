Well, the branch at my university in Aswan is hosting this really big event that we're calling Upper Egypt in Action. It's sort of like EED, but for students in Upper Egypt who are working on graduation projects, or any projects they think could solve problems or be useful for people in the long run, and would like to get financial support and recognition for their work.\n\nIf you're a student in any Engineering school in Upper Egypt and would like to participate, you can visit http://www.upperegyptinaction.com/ to register, and you can even register as a visitor if you'd like to attend the sessions and see this year's projects. The visitors registration page is not up yet though.\n\nI'm not sure I can cover the whole thing in a post, but I'll leave the event link here, and if you have any questions you can ask me or post them there.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/864131057018710/","message_tags":{"903":[{"id":"864131057018710","name":"Upper Egypt In Action 2016","type":"event","offset":903,"length":48}]},"story":"Ahmad Dawoud shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"1200777176707152","name":"Ahmad Dawoud","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}],"41":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":41,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQB89BURjy2VB9lK&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upperegyptinaction.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fmap2.png&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQA1WPAJjktGSDaD","link":"http://www.upperegyptinaction.com/","name":"Upper Egypt In Action","caption":"upperegyptinaction.com","description":"\" UPPER EGYPT IN ACTION \" is a 2-days conference that includes technological & soft skills sessions and exhibition for graduation projects made by Upper Egypt's talented young people .
