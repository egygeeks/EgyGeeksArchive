That's badly-written Turbo C++ for DOS, which despite still being used academically in India and some Arab countries, ought to die. Discouraging its use is a step nearer to that.\n\n(And yes I do know standard-conformance is not always possible/needed. I use GNU extensions extensively at work/private, but at least I can justify it (embedded systems or other low level stuff) and I do know that some of what I write is not \"real\" C. \nExamples meant for a beginner on the other hand should be correct and compilable with any conforming C compiler).","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"904357079604001"},{"created_time":"2015-03-05T01:07:29+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Ahmad Fatoum great information, and yes it was Turbo C++ for Dos 3.0 then 3.2 then 3.22.
