I used Ookla speed test the and iphone speed is 11 MB/s.\n\nI think Vodafone are really giving precedence to the iphone, instead of this being a hardware limitation on the Samsung/USB modem. The Ookla test on the USB modem yields 4.5 MB/s, although in good conditions it should be around 7.5 MB/s (like very late at night).\n\nDid anyone else notice this?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1145521528820887"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1145521528820887"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-05-18T12:16:01+0000","updated_time":"2016-05-19T00:57:30+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1200777176707152","name":"Ahmad Dawoud"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTIwMDc3NzE3NjcwNzE1MgZDZD","after":"MTIwMDc3NzE3NjcwNzE1MgZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-05-18T14:58:32+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmad Alfy","id":"10154097389365670"},"message":"That's weird ...
