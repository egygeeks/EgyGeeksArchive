I investigated a lot in this topic but what I was getting as free at Parse will cost me now 100-200$ monthly in alternative solutions. \nrequirements:\n- I serve 4 million requests per month serving only 20 000 users\n- db is 2 GB\n- I use cloud code / scheduled jobs / push notifications / social authentication.\nNumbers mentioned above will increase with the increase of users.\nHope you can help.

I hoped to get a lot of answers based on real experience. Anyway, Here is most propaply my final decision after days of investigation. firebase is not suotable. amazon is powerfull but complex and has more cost if you pay as you go and didnt pay first. google app engine is easy and cheaper and will become more cheaper on Acoming July. hosting parse server on my responsibility is very risky for my buisoness. so final decision is : in short term: continue on parse for next 1-2 month.  then host parse on Back4app.com which manages parse for you and add missing parts but cost more money. long term to seitch to google app engine and write missing parts with integration with other systems that cover mossing parts such as onesignal.com for push notifications","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1128914550481585"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5TmpNd05EUTFOREEzTlRreU9Eb3hORFl3T1RNeU1qTXkZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5T0RreE5EVTFNRFE0TVRVNE5Ub3hORFl4TWpRM05qQTAZD"}}}}
