It supports \"natural\" UI interactions out-of-the-box. It has its own set of widgets, and a reasonably active community. However, theming/styling does not seem to be straightforward, and it does not have a native look. The latter is a big drawback for me, since I really do want to use it for desktop development and don't care much about cross-platform portability at this point (which is one of the biggest selling points for Kivy, as Muhammad pointed out also) \n\nEnaml is a declarative extension to python for defining UIs (as the author puts it). The cool thing is that you specify the UI framework that you want Enaml to use. So you can use Enaml on top of Qt and have a nice native-looking UI with simple/elegant code. My main issue with it is the lack of active development. It seems to be pretty mature, but development stagnated about 1 year ago.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1256751477697891"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEkxTlRNek1UWTNORFV3TmpVek9Eb3hORGMyTWpNME1Ea3kZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEkxTmpjMU1UUTNOelk1TnpnNU1Ub3hORGMyTXpjek5UZA3gZD"}}}}
