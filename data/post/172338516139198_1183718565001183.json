There are different problems reported among technical communities in Egypt over the past 9 days revolving around targeting SSL connections (VPNs targeting, packet drops, ssl mail server fail..etc). One clear thing is lack of understanding as we don't have a consistent pattern to talk about (examples of interruption include different IPs targeting, ISPs, mix of blocking techniques) and i cant tell for sure what is going on. I have seen and spoke with ppl who are going through total VPN-drops, frequent ssl-mail-server fail..etc and some companies/institutions have total vpn failure for the last 48hrs till now. Basically there are different difficulties related to secure connections but no solid explanation yet and no hint what is going on.. the general sense of course is SSL interception either by MITM-server or DPIs but no any sort of evidence so far. I thought of bringing it up here so we can share our problems we are going through and maybe our collective problems help in reaching a pattern to understand and hopefully resolve it, and maybe any of you can share a possible explanation. Thank you.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1183718565001183"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1183718565001183"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-07-17T13:33:24+0000","updated_time":"2016-07-20T06:45:08+0000","shares":{"count":13},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154500566897615","name":"Khaled Mohi"},{"id":"10211777439690911","name":"Saif Ahmed"},{"id":"10158463331715193","name":"Adel Riyad"},{"id":"10212185537891011","name":"M.

Over the past few months, I had several incidents of apparent traffic throttling for OpenVPN traffic from several locations. I haven't been able to make any PPTP connections at all. Later OpenVPN issues were gone, but still no PPTP.\n\nI worked around this using SSL tunnelled OpenVPN. Until the recent issues. I was completely unable to connect to two OpenVPN servers. One with SSL, and one vanilla. After investigation, he re are my findings:\n- This behaviour is consistent over multiple providers. This usually means someone \"higher\" in the network path is doing it.\n- With the recent issues. I found that I can actually connect to my servers. I found that TLS auth/handshake packets are being dropped after establishing the initial TCP connection. This strongly suggests DPI targeting SSL/TLS traffic.\n- Based on my testing, this is not applied on all traffic. I found that changing the IP address of the server resolved the problem. This suggests that they are working on a pre-selected list of addresses. TBH I was freaked out to realise this and that two of my VPNs are blocked.\n\nFriends have mentioned that they have seen some affected ssh connections, too. But I didn't test that myself.","can_remove":false,"like_count":16,"user_likes":false,"id":"1183748711664835"},{"created_time":"2016-07-17T15:35:20+0000","from":{"name":"Mahmoud Ahmed","id":"10206599251100030"},"message":"Still having issue with web ssl, vpn pptp and ssh connection.

I may add a couple of findings:\n1. TEData just changed all of her routing IPs today. Currently I noticed that all hops inside Egypt are in the 10.x.x.x range. This isn't valid for noor.net till now. Yesterday it was all normal.\n2. Through TEData (I didn't test the others), the output of mtr sometimes gives an extra hop or two when tracing port 443 compared to port 80. This is mainly valid for facebook, but not google. needs much more testing.\n3. OpenVPN through stunnel is throttled to 1mbps, this is on noor network.\n\nMy interpretation is that either we are facing a new survellience equipment being installed, or it was something secretly installed before but went crazy due to DST as it couldn't correctly interpret the TLS packets as it used to do, and they are currently fixing it. By all means this has to be a DPI with SSL MITM capabilities.","can_remove":false,"like_count":6,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154294518798309","length":16,"name":"Mohamed El-Sayed","offset":20,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1183866208319752"},{"created_time":"2016-07-18T18:07:36+0000","from":{"name":"Hosam Aly","id":"1348336588561390"},"message":"Just for the record, I was using a VPN on a Vodafone ADSL connection throughout the past week without issues.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1184522454920794"},{"created_time":"2016-07-20T04:27:34+0000","from":{"name":"Ramy Allam","id":"10211430371857131"},"message":"Does anyone manage to get effective workaround instead of immigration out of Egypt ?\nI'm completely stuck with SSH and OpenVPN connections and has to change the IPs and server locations every single day!","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1185522688154104"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEU0TXpjeU5EazFOVEF3TURVME5Eb3hORFk0TnpZAek16Y3cZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEU0TlRVeU1qWTRPREUxTkRFd05Eb3hORFk0T1RnNE9EVTAZD"}}}}
