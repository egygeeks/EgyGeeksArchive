Your comment doesn't include anything out of the ordinary, so I highly doubt that an admin deleted your comment.\n\nWe rarely resort to such tactics, even some members go as far as insulting some admins and the comments remain in place.\n\nYou've likely commented on the OP's original post, not the OP's \"shared\" post here. Those two have different set of comments. I also commented on the \"shared\" post here. \n\nIf that's the case, that you commented on the original post, then it's not really related to this group. The OP is entitled to do whatever he wants with his post on his own page/profile.
