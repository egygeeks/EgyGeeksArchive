I am considering the step just after getting his interest. I have meet a 16yr old boy who was participating in a regional Google+ hackathon and using PHP and I had the honor to discuss with him and his father how he ended up there! One major idea, that the father didn't even 'get him excited about the idea', rather the boy himself had enough initial interest to mimic websites and to build his own website. On the other hand, the young father was just trying so hard to provide him all available resources and exposing him to different opportunities - and that hackathon was one of them. Another model I witnessed is allowing kids to use robots to visualize their programs. In that model, kids got more excited when they saw the robot following the simple logic they programmed.\nI am not against Scratch itself, but I saw many boys in that age who weren't really interested in the results they get using it. Yet it will be nice to start with and observe the reactions, and if you feel your brother started to lose interest then introduce the next step to him.\nAnother more interesting app in my opinion in that case would be MIT App Inventor http://appinventor.mit.edu/. The main difference, is that at least you can see the results on a mobile phone, which would be more interesting.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"895300697176306"},{"created_time":"2015-02-14T23:19:25+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"Mohamed Hagras try to watch movies without reading subtitles, also watch lots of technical videos and english and read a lot of books.
