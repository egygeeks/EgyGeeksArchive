Delete it quick if the reason for private is testing with no rubbish behind you.\n\n- Have a different repository just for the bower distribution artefacts. A lot of even public OSS projects do that. You can push to it manually or set it up in your build process.\n\n- Instead of a registry, just tell people to install the dependency from the git URL you have. Yes, bower can install dependencies from HTTPS private git repositories. I have done it before. I just stick the URL in the bower.json file and run bower install You can even specify branch name to pull from, or a specific tag.\n\n- You can have a private bower registry and get other people in your team to add manually. I could find a few articles about it with a simple search. I don't see much value of doing that over just installing from the git URL though.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"988857524487289"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVGc0T0RBNE1UUTBORGt5TWpJM09qRTBNemt6TmpZAd056UT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAPVGc0T0RVM05USTBORGczTWpnNU9qRTBNemt6Tnpjd09UUT0ZD"}}}}
