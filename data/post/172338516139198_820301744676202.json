Or I can say \"Play metallica everywhere\" and it will play it across all speakers everywhere, or just play it in the room im in.\"\n\"Another feature (a little less reliable) is if I get a phone call to my hardline, it will query the security system to see the room I am currently In and then it can route the call to wherever I am. If I'm not home, then it will bounce the call to my cell\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2hk8lv/the_1803328_files_on_my_computer_as_an_animator_i_make_lots_of_files_what_do_other_peoples_hard_drives_look_likeoc/cktrnjj","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/820301744676202"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/820301744676202"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-09-27T23:41:02+0000","updated_time":"2014-09-30T06:03:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699550407","name":"Mohamed Tarek El Haddad"},{"id":"100002543270799","name":"Ahmed Abdelfattah"},{"id":"665359179","name":"Ahmed T.
