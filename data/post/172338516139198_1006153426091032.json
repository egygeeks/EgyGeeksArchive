If it impacts your work in some way, do some research to find out if what is being said is true or if it has been something lost in translation. Don't feel bad for using a pattern that has spread across multiple languages and ecosystems successfully, and is probably the reason we have most of the web frameworks we do today. While the ActiveRecord existed well before Rails, it was Rails that gave it a beautiful API and made other frameworks like CodeIgniter, Laravel, .NET, Fuel, Django, etc want to have something comparable.","story":"Moaaz Goda shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"1929189813967524","name":"Moaaz Goda","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"39":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":39,"length":14}]},"link":"http://matthewmachuga.com/blog/2015/activerecord-and-the-beauty-lost-in-translation.html","name":"Matthew Machuga | ActiveRecord and the Beauty Lost in Translation","caption":"matthewmachuga.com","description":"The website for Matthew Machuga.
