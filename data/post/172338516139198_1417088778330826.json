BUT you can NOT really get every book in paper. you can't search , you can't do alot of things. so I had to find an easier way. \n\n- I tried reading on PC screen or laptop  , this will cause you a real eyestrain. also you will have to minimize your book , go back and forth between the book and the IDE . and once you start googling about how to handle eyestrain , you will hit \"eink - electronic ink\"  and many recommendation that a an eink device ( like kindle ) has the magical solution for all your reading problems. \n\n- I bought a Kindle , after using it for just 3 days, I realized that , it is definitely not for technical books. kindle is for novels and anything none technical. also you cant really display PDF or doing zooms. it sucks in PDF .and most of technical books are PDF format. ( all eink devices are the same including 'Nook' ) \n\n- So I bought a tablet :D , I searched for the cheapest 9.7\" ( the recommended size of tablet for reading technical books , this is the size of a standard IPAD , so I bought 'Inar') . reading on tablet is fine but I found that just reading doesn't make you satisfied  , you need to keep your hands busy, like taking notes in pencil ( what you were able to do while reading books in papers )  , also you need to translate some words  , so you go back and forth between dictionary installed on tablet. ( btw now we have google translate popup on android that can translate any word you can copy to clipboard , so you don't have to go back and forth between your page and translator , but still not a full solution for me ) , at the end reading on normal tablet is better than paper and kindle. but not the perfect or near to perfect. \n\n------------------------------\nMy Perfect Solution : \n------------------------------\n- Then I dumped all that , I got two 27\" FHD screens and a disk . you read on one screen ( After setting display mode for the screen you read on to text mode . lower back-light to avoid eye strain , or you can turn night mode in your pdf reader) this really works !  . no eye strain here , also you can copy paste , translate ( buy google translate client and use it , it can translate any word from any app using google translate services ) \n\nThe other screen has your :\n- IDE so you can quickly try anything you want. \n- your Mindmap (mindmup wepapp for me ) . connect what you just learned to other pieces in nodes in a mind map ( that is a good reading technique actually , but it is off topic, ) , btw I am new to web world so this is the mindmap I am building since a while to help me to understand all this sh*** about web https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1HHYY6hz4ErZmozZ1RWaFNMVTQ/view?usp=sharing\n\n- and your notes taking app ( one note ) . to copy paste search results some parts of the PDF ..etc \n\nand Finally you MUST really have a pencil and a paper in your hand all the time while reading when your hand is not on the keyboard. while reading , draw shapes and write a \"mental model\" of what you just learned to paper. believe me when I tell you that the type of the pencil and the paper makes a difference, the paper shouldn't be so soft. use ( دفتر المربعات القديم ده )  , it has a cheap type of paper that is not soft. and use ( قلم رصاص بيتبري مش قلم سنون ) , B1 please :D , or just try different combination of pencil and papers that satisfies you, at the end,  there should be a a good feedback feeling from scratching on papers , there is really some kind of connection between your mind and the feedback feeling you get from drawing and scratching on paper , just try it. \n\nso Two LCDS + paper and pencil + translate app + note taking app + mind map app","can_remove":false,"like_count":12,"user_likes":false,"id":"1417263078313396"},{"created_time":"2017-03-11T15:48:12+0000","from":{"name":"Amr Ragaey","id":"10155099815523748"},"message":"I prefer paper books, but since buying books isn't the economic solution, I tried reading on netbook 10.1\" and my Samsung. I used to dim the netbook screen, install light-weight text editor(sublime) with compiler and was fine to have code practicing while reading.. later on I was in need for quick access to some topics or chapters without the hassle of having PC environment, I found this great application (Moon+ Reader) on Android, It's built to be fully customized with reading environment. I use it in office and transportation, and keep the netbook for reading in home. Both are good solutions for me.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1417607104945660"},{"created_time":"2017-03-11T18:39:56+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"on my laptop, and with a pdf reader for search and quick reference.
