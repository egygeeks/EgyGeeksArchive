The audio playing through the monitor is high pitched and faster than usual. I know it is a software problem because i have dual boot on my laptop and on Windows the same cable/same monitor works just fine. I read that it is a problem in Ubuntu (I am on 14.04) because of difference in sampling rates, I tried some stuff but didn't work out. Anyone had this problem before?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1126187300754310"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1126187300754310"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-04-17T17:54:19+0000","updated_time":"2016-04-17T18:51:01+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1118459391596579","name":"Mohamad Emad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTExODQ1OTM5MTU5NjU3OQZDZD","after":"MTExODQ1OTM5MTU5NjU3OQZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-04-17T18:31:55+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed Hussien","id":"10154099730567024"},"message":"No im using Ubuntu 14.04 and i have windows alongside and i do the same as u connecting my laptop with external screen throw HDMI cable with no problems ! that's weired.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1126204387419268"},{"created_time":"2016-04-17T18:43:38+0000","from":{"name":"Amr Yousef","id":"10212914666760274"},"message":"Make sure to use the proprietary drivers as it gives better experience  especially wih Nvidia.
