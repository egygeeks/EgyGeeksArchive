The latest issues is randomly getting 404 errors. The issue is completely random, not related to a certain site or a certain time.\n\nI tried changing my DNS server to 8.8.8.8 to no effect. The issue only goes away when I use an SSH tunnel to a USA server, which of course is too slow for daily usage.\n\nI appreciate any help on this matter, since my incompetent ISP do not even know where to start looking.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/955340267839015"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/955340267839015"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-06-07T11:05:28+0000","updated_time":"2015-06-07T13:31:18+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10212782797230132","name":"Diaa Sami"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTI3ODI3OTcyMzAxMzIZD","after":"MTAyMTI3ODI3OTcyMzAxMzIZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-06-07T11:08:43+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed El-Kholy","id":"10154903509466885"},"message":"I had a similar issue with a TEDATA connection with some parameter that needed adjustment , it was about maximum frame size or something like this (layer 2 parameter) it should be 66 or something like that , I changed my modem and didnt have the sameissue later so I can't remember the exact names and values","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"955341254505583"},{"created_time":"2015-06-07T11:14:37+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Al-Amir","id":"10155179919799180"},"message":"Was that \"MTU Size\"?\n\nIt was set to a default value of 1500, a bit of online research showed that LinkDSL (which is the provider behind my ISP) uses a value of 1492.
