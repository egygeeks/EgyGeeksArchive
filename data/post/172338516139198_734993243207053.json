Here is what I learnt\n\n1. WebSockets is the most efficient, but it's not supported in all browsers. See http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets\n\n2. Long polling is less efficient than websockets, because you're still using HTTP with all its overhead. \n\n3. There are other techniques to get server notifications, depending on the browser & server.\n\n4. There are different tools to abstract these techniques. They use the most suitable technique for your browser. They also require support from your server software. Examples: SignalR (.net only AFAIK), Socket.io (mainly NodeJS, but supported on different server-side stacks) & SockJS (similar in purpose to socket.io)\n\n5. There are products which allows you to send server notifications without installing anything extra on your server stack. Examples: Firebase & Pusher.\n\nThis is not comprehensive. There are many things that I heard about but didn't have enough time to investigate: TogetherJS, WebRTC, Faye, Google Drive Real-time.
