The reason we push people to do it isn't because it's useful today, it's because it's useful tomorrow.\nIt's useful the day you find your software broken up into 10 different moving parts, integrated with external and internal systems, it's that time when you can't for the life of you write a component or replace a file without breaking something if you are not careful, *really* careful.\n\nSo what do we do? We let the system take care of it, you've already written your tests and your systems integration is all green, today you are replacing a file. Done your deed? Now run the tests to see if anything broke.\n\nIt's more of a retrospective activity. Can you replace it with anything else? Sure, you can deploy to a staging server. But then again we hit a bug that affected 20% of our user base, it's breaking the experience.\nLast thing you'll think about is pushing to a staging server and **manually** testing..\n\nNo, you'll push to a production server a quick fix and hope to god it doesn't break something, or fix, run tests and push.\n\nLastly, when your product grows into some two digits feature set, you will not for the life of you recall to test out every possible scenario manually.\nKeep a deployment checklist, or a feature checklist, cool it'll still be a pain.\n13 clicks and 4 inputs or one command and get a slice of that pizza?
