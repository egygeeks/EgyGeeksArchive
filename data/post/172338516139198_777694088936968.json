They also require the merchant to be a registered legal entity.\n\nSpreedly will require the merchant to be a registered legal entity because the only reason they support Egypt is because they support MiGS and the only two banks that offer MiGS are the Al Ahly bank and the Arab African bank.\nBoth of which are not so keen on giving out merchant accounts specially to a company they don't have a joint contract with, like Spreedly.\n\nNote: Dealing with banks in Egypt to acquire a merchant account is no different than selling your soul to the devil to get a meal you're willing to pay for.\n\nPayfort will require the merchant to be a registered legal entity because \n1) It's too expensive \n2) It has a joint contract with Al Ahly bank \n3) You'll need to sign a contract with them and the bank\n\nNote: Payfort's system is notoriously bad, poorly documented and just shit stupid. But... It works, not so well for recurring billing though (You'll end up implementing a recurring payments system on top of their Gateway).\n\nBlueSnap is like Payfort. Except Payfort is Arab (Duabi based with an Egyptian founder if I'm not mistaken)\n\nSkrill (Formally moneybookers) is just crap. Steer away from it, it follows the traditional model of redirecting a customer to their website. One good point about them is you can  charge non-skrill users.\n\nWallety is Egyptian, same model as Skrill but require your customers to have an account on Wallety\n\nCashU similar to the previous two, also require your customers to have an account but popular and trusted amongst Arabs\n\nFastSpring is so far the only off-site experience that's somewhat acceptable, but it's invitation only and they're extremely selective.\n\nIf I had to recommend something, I'd recommend not accepting payments as an Egyptian business and incorporate outside Egypt. In such case you'll have access to one of the following four which I highly recommend:\n\n- Stripe\n- Pin payments in Australia\n- Paymill in Europe\n- Authorize.net\n\nSince establishing a business outside Egypt for non-residents is notoriously painful for most people, I'd recommend CashU, FastSpring or Spreedly.\n\nGood luck.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-07-06T19:42:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"778149742224736","from":{"id":"544815169","name":"Mohamed Meligy"},"message":"Cash or SMS in Egypt, PayPal in gulf, like UAE.","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-07-07T00:45:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOemM0TVRRNU56UXlNakkwTnpNMk9qRTBNRFEyT1RNNU1UZzZMVEU9","before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZOemMzT0RBd09EZzRPVEkyTWpnNE9qRTBNRFEyTlRrd05URTZMVEU9"}}}}
