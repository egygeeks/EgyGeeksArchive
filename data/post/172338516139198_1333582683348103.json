The only way to do it in a decent way is by using SSML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_Synthesis_Markup_Language), (https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference) using the ipa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) or x-sampa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) alphabet. \n\nMy problems is that i have no idea how to pronounce the names correctly using any of those alphabets, and i haven't found any resource for that online. \n\nI'd appreciate any help, specially if any one has experience with phonetic alphabets.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1333582683348103"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1333582683348103"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-12-21T13:37:21+0000","updated_time":"2016-12-21T17:03:46+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1331663420227478","name":"Omar Mohsen"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTMzMTY2MzQyMDIyNzQ3OAZDZD","after":"MTMzMTY2MzQyMDIyNzQ3OAZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-12-21T17:03:41+0000","from":{"name":"Hosam Aly","id":"1348336588561390"},"message":"Wikipedia articles usually show how to pronounce a word.
