The only obvious way I can think of that the drivers devices send their location each small interval of time like 2~5 seconds, but I know that there is a limit on the number of free requests by google. What is the best way to handle this? Is the only way to pay google for the extra requests :)? Would love to hear your experience on that.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1344130185626686"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1344130185626686"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-01-02T22:55:23+0000","updated_time":"2017-01-04T09:23:05+0000","shares":{"count":1},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1349979731730434","name":"Ashraf Hefny"},{"id":"10154876688426014","name":"Islam Azab"},{"id":"10211609665746652","name":"Mohammad Aboelnour"},{"id":"10154835351891005","name":"Hossam Ahmed"},{"id":"10154345980398144","name":"Ahmad Akl"},{"id":"428651860800863","name":"Seif Atalla"},{"id":"10154937488445610","name":"Mohamed El Henawy"},{"id":"10155888446923102","name":"Mahmoud Khaled"},{"id":"1389414997811648","name":"Ahmed Tarek"},{"id":"732593483584610","name":"Yehia Beram"},{"id":"10210653485386787","name":"Shady Atef"},{"id":"10155245212743678","name":"Sabrin El-Guindy"},{"id":"10154535980341656","name":"Amir Amgad"},{"id":"764330700401706","name":"Abdallah El Attar"},{"id":"1364997500240454","name":"Mohamed AbuIssa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTM0OTk3OTczMTczMDQzNAZDZD","after":"MTM2NDk5NzUwMDI0MDQ1NAZDZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-01-02T22:56:59+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abousamra","id":"10154800961930546"},"message":"Yehia ELsaka Yassin Gamal you may be interested in that :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154463368097219","length":12,"name":"Yehia ELsaka","offset":0,"type":"user"},{"id":"10208488298905131","length":12,"name":"Yassin Gamal","offset":13,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1344130945626610"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T23:01:47+0000","from":{"name":"Abdelrahman Omran","id":"2022367384657074"},"message":"Firebase is the best solution for this case :)","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1344132722293099"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T23:12:13+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Hashem","id":"1786709881592928"},"message":"There is PubNub service its so like firebase but i think they have an example for location tracking","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1344137922292579"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T23:12:49+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Abousamra","id":"10154800961930546"},"message":"Mahmoud Adam any thoughts ?","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10154930440846071","length":12,"name":"Mahmoud Adam","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1344138318959206"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T23:17:03+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Hashem","id":"1786709881592928"},"message":"And there is a difference between how Uber handle this particular part of there system and how you do it with a minimum cost","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1344139885625716"},{"created_time":"2017-01-02T23:21:51+0000","from":{"name":"Fady Dawood","id":"1549509475089044"},"message":"Maged Magdy Samuel A.
