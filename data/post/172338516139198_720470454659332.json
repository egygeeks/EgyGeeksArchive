That's a stretch.\n\nThe number of developers that do Javascript in what sense in comparison to C? \nJavascript is first and foremost a scripting language not a full-featured programming language. The reason it's gaining traction is the node.js environment and toolchain.\n\nThe number of node.js developers as compared to C is far lower than what one would normally anticipate in a knee-jerk assumption.\n\nYou have thousands upon thousands of packages for every flavour that has ever existed and is still maintained of *nix systems. Most of which are either in C or C++\n\nYou have the hundreds of developers contributing daily to the maintenance of these *nix systems. Not to mention the grand majority of most language implementations including node.js and most of your favourite browsers are all either in C, C++ or both. And the thousands of contributing developers + their core teams.\n\nGame engines, toolchains, mission-critical commercial quality software deployments from space programs to missile guidance systems. Most of weapon grade code development deployed in some of the most sophisticated war machinery out there. From helicopters to tanks.\n\nCars, factory automation systems, satellites, receivers and broad casting technologies. Most of the embedded technologies.\n\nIt's all either C, C++ or something built on-top or in C or C++. I think it's a fair bet to say C-family engineers out number any other technology out there.\n\nNow if we are talking about Javascript as a client-side scripting language, then that's a whole different story.\n\nEdit: Javascript as a community has potential. If its community ever turns into more backend engineers than frontend engineers. The knowledge set of a backend engineer differs greatly than that of a frontend engineer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-26T19:29:24+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"720623897977321","from":{"id":"100001458637962","name":"Ahmed El-Jabry"},"message":"جافا سكريبت وامبدد سيستم دونت ميكس =D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-26T21:15:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"720674254638952","from":{"id":"519692291","name":"Hassan Aly Selim"},"message":"Ahmed El-Jabry some crazy developers just like to mix stuff keda, .Net on Android, .Net on a Microprocessor (netduino), Windows on ARM, (Macromedia!)
