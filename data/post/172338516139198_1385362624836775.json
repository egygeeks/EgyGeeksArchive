I bit the bullet and flashed the latest LinageOS 14.1 experimental builds on it... it is not perfect, the camera needs improvement and few audio bugs, but other than that, a very noticeable difference in speed and experience of the very latest \"almost\" vanilla Android.\n\nInterested to hear your opinions and experiences!","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1385362624836775"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1385362624836775"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-02-11T16:31:41+0000","updated_time":"2017-02-13T08:13:21+0000","shares":{"count":1},"is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"181015452391014","name":"Mohamed Salah"},{"id":"10158413973420512","name":"Abbas Adel Ibrahim"},{"id":"10208593038455809","name":"Mahmoud Khalil"},{"id":"10155114143499595","name":"Adam Moneib"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTgxMDE1NDUyMzkxMDE0","after":"MTAxNTUxMTQxNDM0OTk1OTUZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2017-02-12T12:26:48+0000","from":{"name":"Mohammed El Sayed","id":"10154884040390170"},"message":"My phone (oneplus one) is actually built from the start on top of Cyanogen, so I totally understand that feeling of getting the latest Android bug fixes and new versions before the majority, and also to get some neat features that gives you an edge over most of the other phones out there. \nCurrently I'm planning to install LineageOS and see how the phone will perform.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1386281994744838"},{"created_time":"2017-02-13T08:13:18+0000","from":{"name":"Islam AbdelMohaimen Hassan","id":"10211887209872216"},"message":"I used Omni ROM on my old Galaxy note II, uses half the RAM and consumes half the power that the original ROM.
