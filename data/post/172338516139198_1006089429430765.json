I havent used react before but had a sneak peak at its features\nBut here I'm worried the code may get more complex and I'm not sure if rails would do better than meteor concerning performance\n\nNeed to know ur opinions guys and thank you!","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1006089429430765"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1006089429430765"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2015-09-14T00:08:32+0000","updated_time":"2015-09-14T09:48:50+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10211242369566436","name":"Ebram Tharwat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAyMTEyNDIzNjk1NjY0MzYZD","after":"MTAyMTEyNDIzNjk1NjY0MzYZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2015-09-14T01:28:56+0000","from":{"name":"Meligy","id":"10154884040385170"},"message":"Big sites survived on well known technologies. Rails perf was an issue for twitter at some stage. When you get to that stage, it will be a nice problem to have. Don't  think about it now.\n\nMost successful websites have many parts of their code rewritten \"several times\", and their architecture revisited as well of course.\n\nSo, don't worry about it too much. If you do, go with Rails. You can't go wrong with Rails.\n\nRepeating myself like hell: when Rails becomes the bottleneck, either you have done something stupid using it, or you (your site) became big enough that solving that problem becomes an investment you spend happily on a nice problem to have.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1006132576093117"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF3TmpFek1qVTNOakE1TXpFeE56b3hORFF5TVRrME1UTTIZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF3TmpFek1qVTNOakE1TXpFeE56b3hORFF5TVRrME1UTTIZD"}}}}
