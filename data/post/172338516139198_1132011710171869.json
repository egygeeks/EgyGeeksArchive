And it is actually impressive.\nTo sum up:\n- This is a kernel emulator, it emulates kernel APIs for Linux programs.\n- it handles File Modes and permissions and inserts them in NTFS extended attributes.\n- Currently IPv6 might have some issues. if you have IPv4 it should work fine.\n- You can run Ruby or Python and most of the GNU/Linux tools.\n- Currently the Linux process is separate from the Win32 world, it runs in its own session (a windows term that is somewhat similar to a container), so /bin/ps will not show Windows processes running on Windows. (Confirm?)\n- In the future they plan to span multiple Linux instances in multiple sessions, so each bash can be its own container (this might mean native docker support?)\n- Difference from Cygwin and Msys, these are compiled ports to Win32 processes, while now you can run actual linux compiled code.\n- Difference from the discontinued SFU that exists in Windows Server (Windows Subsystem [or Services] for Unix).\nThe difference is that SFU was emulating user mode calls to Win32 equivalents which is a much larger number of API than the Kernel mode.\n- Not all the Kernel syscalls are implemented yet.\n- Linux apps run in a pico-process (search DrawBridge), so a linux app cannot call a win32 user-mode APIs (also win32 apps cannot invoke linux syscalls),","story":"Mohammad Fouad shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154777096910845","name":"Mohammad Fouad","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}],"43":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":43,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCqADQZvij7rqPc&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.ch9.ms%2Fch9%2Fad03%2F33a90710-0d66-4c48-8f7f-db974771ad03%2FWSFLArchitectureDeepuThomas_512.jpg&cfs=1&sx=0&sy=0&sw=288&sh=288&_nc_hash=AQChzVM-uObYUA9a","link":"https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Seth-Juarez/Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux-Architectural-Overview","name":"Windows Subsystem for Linux: Architectural Overview (Channel 9)","caption":"channel9.msdn.com","description":"In this video Deepu Thomas lays down the real scoop behind the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
