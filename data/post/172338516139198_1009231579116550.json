I kept postponing this comment because I don't have a short version in my mind. But here's a try: \n\nAfter spending enough years in the field you realise it's more about people than it's about code. You learn so much about the dynamics of a good project. You learn how much bigger of an impact a good coach / mentor is any your project and on the devs they work with.\n\nYou realise that even as a coder you often have to have superior communication skills to make a difference (so, a good code is almost never someone who is bad with people skills).\n\nEventually you understand your value is your influence on people around you no matter what your role is, not primarily your skill. And the more influence the bigger the win obviously.\n\nChoosing to ignore this, (while a free choice) is a failure. Not realising that it's true at all is also a failure. The result of that failure is so many missed opportunities to make a bigger impact on the world.\n\nHowever, on a second thought, \"Failure\" can be defined by missing something you wanted. If you didn't want to have this impact, then maybe you didn't fail, but you lost / missed a lot of opportunities. So, feel free to replace \"failure\" above with \"loss\" / \"miss\".","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1009844995721875"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF3T1RJMU16RTJNalEwTnpjeU5Ub3hORFF5TnpJNU9ESTUZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEF3T1RnME5EazVOVGN5TVRnM05Ub3hORFF5T0RRek9UQTAZD"}}}}
