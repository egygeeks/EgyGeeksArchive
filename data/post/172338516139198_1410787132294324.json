It discourages the use of asserts for two reason:\n1- Why add a new dependency when you can just do it with a simple condition?\nFor example:\nif assert.For(t).ThatActual(err).IsNil() { .. }\ncan be easily written as :\nwant := ...\ngot := ...\nif want != got { t.Errorf(...) }\n\n2- Assertions end the test earlier when it could have continued. Some assertion failures can be tolerated and the test can continue and test more stuff. That's why we have Errorf and Fatalf. That's actually the reason that convinced me not to use an assertion library.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1410889862284051"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF4TURnNE9UZAzJNakk0TkRBMU1Ub3hORGc0TnprNU5EQTEZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVFF4TURnNE9UZAzJNakk0TkRBMU1Ub3hORGc0TnprNU5EQTEZD"}}}}
