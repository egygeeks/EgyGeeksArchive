I am a web developer but due to the project size i considered Java Swing, as it is easy to install and doesn't require an application server to run it. \n\ndue to your experience, is this a good decision. java swing with old JDBC is fine with small apps ?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/853220544717655"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/853220544717655"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-11-29T00:07:54+0000","updated_time":"2014-11-29T15:07:31+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-11-29T00:20:36+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Samy","id":"10158821643510355"},"message":"why not?

Thus if you are learning something complex you will take a lot of time which will make the project revenue like nothing for you.. the more simple, fast the better it is for business apps if you are seeking revenue ... otherwise, if you are seeking to get some knowledge and invest in yourself ...

What I suggest is (it might be wrong):\nsince you are a web developer, you can use different web technologies to accomplish the assigned project .. afterwards you can either submit a documentation for the people who are going to use that app for the clients so that they get to know how to use it or you simply educate them of how to use the app.\n\nWeb server might be a problem if you are working with web technologies ..
