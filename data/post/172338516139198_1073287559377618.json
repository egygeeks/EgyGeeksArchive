They're built where energy and land are cheap (not close to where people actually live). And they waste so much energy cooling their massive computers.\n\nThe ocean can solve those problems. Ocean currents can produce enough energy to power the sub-sea data centers. The cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components inside the pod. And since most people live near the ocean, placing data centers under water could potentially increase the speed at which customers could access the information stored in Microsoft's cloud.\"","story":"Mosab Ibrahim shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10154868571206047","name":"Mosab Ibrahim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}],"42":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":42,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAwrNY8nMgs6zHW&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.cdn.turner.com%2Fmoney%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F160201142130-microsoft-under-water-data-center-2-780x439.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQCze-o-ZoZ4UN9q","link":"http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/01/technology/microsoft-underwater-data-center/index.html","name":"Microsoft just put a data center under water","caption":"money.cnn.com","description":"Water and electronics usually don't mix.
