BDD over TDD but throwing TDD out is not practical. The article scopes this within Rails as an environment to test against which is at best true.\n\nFunny though, he's always been vocally pro TDD, almost religiously.\n\nWeb is an interface and experience driven platform, a proper test of a feature eventually ends up with firing up your browser and actually trying it. Why not let the system do it for you? We've used Cucumber for years and still use it, never looked back.\n\nUnit testing is great in cases as much as regression and acceptance testing is great in other cases. Both tend to go hand in hand, I've yet to see a large scale web project that doesn't use both.\n\nOn the other hand, having built a lot of APIs and API  tools from support utilities to bindings on more than half a dozen languages, unit testing is by far indispensable and test-first __is__ the way to go about in the late stages of API design.\n\nThe problem he mentions starts to manifest on a team above 3-4 members with a long-term project. Unit testing forces you to zone in onto specific code units that are very likely tangled up in a soup of dependencies which eventually forces you to isolate it.\n\nIsolation means you need your tests to be as atomic as possible, only affecting a single unit so you start mocking and stubbing everything around that unit. It gets messy fast, cumbersome and misleading.\n\nYou're no longer interested in how a system functions on a full operational scale, you're interested in how that corner of your architecture is designed and implemented for that \"unit test\".","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-04-23T18:12:16+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"735627583143619","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"(2011) http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-offended-by-rspec-debate-4610.html","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-04-23T18:25:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"735717139801330","from":{"id":"627907956","name":"Emad Elsaid"},"message":":D يا مقلب القلوب","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-04-23T22:00:19+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"735908166448894","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":":D","can_remove":true,"created_time":"2014-04-24T07:25:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzM1OTA4MTY2NDQ4ODk0","before":"NzM1NjIzMjg5ODEwNzE1"}}}}
