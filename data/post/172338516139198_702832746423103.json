Our industry has a history of insinuating laziness and the lack of mastery by the magnitude of tools at a developer's disposal.\nIt's for instance, not uncommon for a Java developer to know more about the innards of her platform than a .Net developer.\n\nWhy? Because of the tooling given to a Java developer, at what stage is it given and how does the community feel about it. \nThe grand majority of Java developers for example learn to construct GUIs by hand before they move to a GUI builder. That isn't the case with .Net, same for packaging a project, as two naive examples but common amongst beginners.\n\nPeople with a long history of imperative programming knowledge and dynamic typing face problems when moving to a more rigid line of thoughts like functional programming and different typing systems. A common luxury not present in FP is variable mutability, non-recursive iteration structures.\n\nBut you also can't argue that it isn't entirely the developer's responsibility and technology -although a contributing factor- isn't the sole offender here.
