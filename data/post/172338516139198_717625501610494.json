Upon inspection, it turns out it was a dark pattern.\n\nThe service offered a 14 days trial for £1. No where on their website do they mention a monthly subscription fee and for how much. No where on their website do they link to a pricing page.\n\nBut get this, it's actually mentioned in their terms of service...  http://jukebux.com/terms.php?lang=uk clause 4\n\nIt's a rare occasion for an average joe computer user to read the terms of service and those who do, rarely understand it.\n\nSo they get your credit card on system, charge you £1. You agreed to the terms of service likely without reading it, TOS mention a EUR/GBP 50 charge upon the trial ending and next thing, you're wondering what happened to your money.\n\nAnyway, that's that. Jukebux, a dark patterns embracer. There's a much more deeper plot behind what actually happened, how they scammed her into getting an account (She didn't knowingly know she was signing up for a Jukebux account) I'm still investigating how this happened.\n\nLesson:\n**Read The Terms Of Service**","story":"Hady Ahmed shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"10210684524123349","name":"Hady Ahmed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"39":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":39,"length":14}]},"link":"http://darkpatterns.org/","name":"Dark Patterns - User Interfaces Designed to Trick People","caption":"darkpatterns.org","description":"Dark Patterns: fighting user deception worldwideA Dark Pattern is a type of user interface that appears to have been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.Normally when you think of “bad design”, you think o...","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/717625501610494"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/717625501610494"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2014-03-20T11:43:25+0000","updated_time":"2014-03-20T12:20:08+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-03-20T11:55:46+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"http://tosdr.org/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"717628241610220"},{"created_time":"2014-03-20T12:19:17+0000","from":{"name":"Moutaz Shams","id":"1647326241951498"},"message":"صعب على حد عادي برضو يقرا ويفهم كلام قانوني بالطول ده كتبه محامين الشيطان وفي الآخر لو اللي كتب الكلام ده عايز يتوه الناس ويبقى قانونيا تمام يقدر يلعب بالكلام عادي. الأسهل هو جوجل وقراءة reviews والخ","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"717634848276226"},{"created_time":"2014-03-20T12:20:08+0000","from":{"name":"Moutaz Shams","id":"1647326241951498"},"message":"Lesson Learned: ** don't give your cc to your gf ** :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"717635184942859"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekUzTmpJNE1qUXhOakV3TWpJd09qRXpPVFV6TVRZAMU5EWT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekUzTmpNMU1UZAzBPVFF5T0RVNU9qRXpPVFV6TVRnd01EZAz0ZD"}}}}
