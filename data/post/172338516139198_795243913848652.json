I would suggest that the index action uses your JSON API directly as a typical client (service-url/status), parses the JSON and directs the view to render what it wants. \n- I think that the test is fake, right?\n- As you probably know, parsing their html is not stable from your API viewpoint, but I think this is the only method you have for now ...\n- By the load distribution over time, are you going to parse this page MiniCurrentLoadClock2.aspx? I would suggest moving your API one step forward and incorporate sort of prediction based on the load distribution .. now you provide something, egyptera doesn't provide ..\n- Why GPL? :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-07T03:30:04+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"795295017176875","from":{"id":"755026046","name":"Mosab Ahmad"},"message":"#1 that was my plan, but I wanted to sleep and I was being super lazy :)\n\n#2 I agree\n\n#3 right, generated automaticaly\n\n#4 Agreed\n\n#5 Great idea\n\n#6 Why not?! :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-07T03:31:44+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"795295500510160","from":{"id":"755026046","name":"Mosab Ahmad"},"message":"Also, you are welcome to fork the code and introduce whatever features you like :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-07T03:33:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"795296060510104","from":{"id":"1486650909","name":"Khaled M.
