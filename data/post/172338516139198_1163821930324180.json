This is the organizer of the AngularJS meetup in Sydney, ng-sydney\n\n- Can I use Angular 2 in LTS projects?\n\nYes. Several people in my meetup have been reporting using it for work in the last 2 months at least, including enterprise apps.\n\n- How about performance?\n\nThis is one of the main features in Angular 2!\n\n- Is it stable?\n\nNot 100%. There are still some changes happening with routing and forms. Not too crazy to be deal breakers though, except yes, expect a few.\n\nHappy to take any further questions you may have.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1164143913625315"},{"created_time":"2016-06-18T06:16:32+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"I would personally not have trouble building Apps in Angular 2 and would have it in the list of acceptable technologies, in any case, it is a JS client side framework, so I would use it to build SPAs of limited/meduim size for my organization, something that could be built in 2-4 2 week sprints with 3 devs in a team.
