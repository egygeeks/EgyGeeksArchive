It's pretty popular that it should be easy to find apps / browser plugins for. https://www.google.com/search?q=Pomodoro+reminder+for+windows\n\nIn the standard form of this technique you work for 25 minutes then take 5 minutes break. However, customizations like working 50 minutes and taking 10 minutes break are popular as well, and I think  are supported in many apps.\n\nIf you consider other options besides native desktop OS apps, like browser extensions and phone apps, the range of stuff you can find using the keywords \"Pomodoro app\" will increase a lot.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1299997916706580"},{"created_time":"2016-11-21T09:30:21+0000","from":{"name":"Meena Bassem","id":"10210549533432270"},"message":"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-tools-remind-break-relax-working-computer/","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"id":"1299998116706560"},{"created_time":"2016-11-21T09:43:10+0000","from":{"name":"Mostafa Hussein","id":"599781276899213"},"message":"If there is no tools on linux then create your own script and add it to the crontab :D","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1300003666706005"},{"created_time":"2016-11-21T10:15:11+0000","from":{"name":"Khaled Fares","id":"1051388154965675"},"message":"Mohamed Elsherif\nليه الراجل لما سأل عن حاجة في asp \nاعتبرتوها Searchable\n و مسحتوا البوست بتاعه و حاجة زي كدة موجودة عادي و الناس بترد؟! عمري ما قدرت اشوف اتساق في تطبيق معايير الجروب الصراحة.","can_remove":false,"like_count":4,"message_tags":[{"id":"10158483817400314","length":16,"name":"Mohamed Elsherif","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1300025180037187"},{"created_time":"2016-11-21T11:48:40+0000","from":{"name":"Omar Essam","id":"10155098857034860"},"message":"Try \nhttp://gnomepomodoro.org/","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1300069090032796"},{"created_time":"2016-11-22T06:59:43+0000","from":{"name":"Diaa Sami","id":"10212782797230132"},"message":"Cooktimer\nhttps://github.com/diaasami/cooktimer","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1301010793271959"},{"created_time":"2016-11-22T08:14:33+0000","from":{"name":"Anas Rabei","id":"621823724675667"},"message":"Maybe this is not the same as you need but it may help\nIt is a blog post (For linux users) explains about 10 different applications for healthy usage of the computer.
