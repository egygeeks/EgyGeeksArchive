This example illustrate how you could get a driving route and from this point you can get the positions of each marker and then proceed with the first answer i gave to you. However, if you need to give the user the capability to navigate from X to Y while driving, i would advice you to send the longitude and the latitude  to start navigating to the destination ( Using the Google Navigation app).
