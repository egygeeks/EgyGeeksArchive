One of the lead implementers of Test Performance, and an expert using HP Load Runner at Asset Technology Group. ° Created various Automation Scripts that directly affected the testing team performance, and reduced time to market considerably. ° Created and documented various Process Improvement modifications, and assisted with the implementation and adoption of the improved process internally.\n\nWorkshop Description\nAbout Software Performance Testing:\n\nPerformance testing is a type of non-functional testing, testing that is performed, to determine how fast some aspect of a system performs under a particular workload. It can serve different purposes like it can demonstrate that the system meets performance criteria. It can compare two systems to find which performs better. Or it can measure what part of the system or workload causes the system to perform badly. This process can involve quantitative tests done in a lab, such as measuring the response time or the number of MIPS (millions of instructions per second) at which a system functions).\n \nBenefits for Performance Testing\n \n1-Improve user experience on sites and web apps\n2-Increase revenue generated from websites\n3-Gather metrics useful for tuning the system\n4-Identify bottlenecks such as database configuration\n5-Determine if a new release is ready for production\n6--Provide reporting to business stakeholders regarding performance against expectations\n\nRegistration Fees: (Free)\n\nRegistration link:\nhttp://www.deltait.org/event-2155374\n\n*Note : End date for registration is next wednesday 3rd February for attendees outside Mansoura University , this is in order to complete the university enterance registration process as soon as possible\n\nFor more information, please send an email to Training@hayvision.com\nand one of our experts will respond to your inquiry or call us at:\nlandline:050-4031414\nMobile:+20101 555 22 00","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/event.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1070864816286559"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1070864816286559"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"event","object_id":"1675231626068806","created_time":"2016-01-30T14:23:37+0000","updated_time":"2016-01-30T14:23:37+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false}
