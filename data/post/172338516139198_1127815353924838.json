I'm flooded with results though.

The way these two plugins work is by backing up all your files and database into one zip file, in addition to a php \"extractor\" file.\n\nIf you are working with a larger website, having a 1GB+ zip backup of your website might not be that helpful when it's time to download/upload it. In that case, I would do a local backup and use an FTP for compare and sync, or git if you prefer, plus the database backup, manual or with a plugin. There is this powerful database backup tool https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/, if you want a git type workflow, and want to make database migration just as easy to push and pull (expensive for my needs but seems popular online).\n\nThere are also web hosting services that offer decent WordPress backup solutions and integration with git.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1127957090577331"},{"created_time":"2016-04-20T08:54:40+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Amgad","id":"10212303086792312"},"message":"you can just use Docker\nhttps://www.docker.com/","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1127965350576505"},{"created_time":"2016-04-20T17:50:44+0000","from":{"name":"Eslam Hamouda","id":"10210277573008432"},"message":"I'm using a plugin called \"BackWPup\" for more than a year with no problems at all, i'm scheduling a weekly full backup to my Dropbox account and it works very smoothly.\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup/","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1128326027207104"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5TnpnNE9EUXhNRFU0TkRFNU9Ub3hORFl4TVRNeU1UZA3oZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5T0RNeU5qQXlOekl3TnpFd05Eb3hORFl4TVRjME5qUTEZD"}}}}
