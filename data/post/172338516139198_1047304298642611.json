An Easier, faster, and efficient way to create websites.\n\nFirst, you create a ts class file that extends web.ts.Page.\n\nSecond, Implement the View() Method to return the location of the view page you would like to show, for example, \"/Page1.txt\". You can also return #element (id of an element), which returns the outerHTML content of an element in the document page. The View source file can be designed with HTML Designer softwares.\n\nThird, you implement the Render(document) method callback which is used to render the content when it's already available.\n\nFourth, create instance of this class and cal Load() method to ask to fethch the document in View() and Render(doc) when it's finished fetching.\n\nFifth, Pages are loaded when a Url change is detected and load a different page based on the name of the Hash.\n","story":"Ahmed Saleh shared a link to the group: Egyptian Geeks.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"1384434324953403","name":"Ahmed Saleh","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}],"40":[{"id":"172338516139198","name":"Egyptian Geeks","type":"group","offset":40,"length":14}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDHpf8Fkfeis7pq&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F16297164%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDpLvYEtyXLirTe","link":"https://github.com/medozs/web.ts","name":"medozs/web.ts","caption":"github.com","description":"web.ts - Create Web Apps the Object Oriented way","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/post.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1047304298642611"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1047304298642611"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"link","status_type":"shared_story","created_time":"2015-12-17T21:16:53+0000","updated_time":"2015-12-17T21:16:53+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"1811475205784288","name":"Bassam Abd Elhamid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTgxMTQ3NTIwNTc4NDI4OAZDZD","after":"MTgxMTQ3NTIwNTc4NDI4OAZDZD"}}}}
