If the only solution is to keep the models and database, and rewrite the controllers and views; What is the easiest Java web framework to re-implement the system?\n\nThanks in advance.","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1189754991064207"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/1189754991064207"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2016-07-26T17:44:18+0000","updated_time":"2016-07-27T02:54:12+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10154933026461285","name":"Ahmed Anis El-Sayed"},{"id":"10154886702266007","name":"Mona Shokrof"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"MTAxNTQ5MzMwMjY0NjEyODUZD","after":"MTAxNTQ4ODY3MDIyNjYwMDcZD"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2016-07-26T17:46:42+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Negm","id":"10212131509466411"},"message":"Amjad Mashaal","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"message_tags":[{"id":"10210954655734032","length":13,"name":"Amjad Mashaal","offset":0,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"1189755914397448"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T17:48:09+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"SPRING without a doubt, I was hoping you were using it with JavaFX in the first place at least for dependency injection.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189756467730726"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T17:48:30+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"P.S you can reuse CSS","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189756641064042"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T17:52:16+0000","from":{"name":"Mohamed Hassan Gad-Elrab","id":"10210944236335646"},"message":"You may create web client using Playframework","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189758324397207"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T17:53:41+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"webfx, don't know it but looks like it is worth a try https://jaxenter.com/javafx-becomes-the-new-html-with-webfx-2-106813.html","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189758714397168"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T18:08:52+0000","from":{"name":"Amjad Mashaal","id":"10210954655734032"},"message":"Let's Encrypt should work regarding the certificates","can_remove":false,"like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189768951062811"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T19:43:40+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Mahfouz","id":"10212072846353700"},"message":"+1 let's encrypt","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189812854391754"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T20:34:20+0000","from":{"name":"Ahmed Atalla","id":"423597977977586"},"message":"If you design the project well , separate parts as recommended, the you can rewrite only the view part  as a web client","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189833631056343"},{"created_time":"2016-07-26T20:37:15+0000","from":{"name":"Said Bakr","id":"10154979109648745"},"message":"نقطة عامة ليست على علاقة مباشرة بموضوعك: لهذا وجب الاتفاق على المتطلبات النهائية للعميل قبل بدء التنفيذ","can_remove":false,"like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"id":"1189834437722929"},{"created_time":"2016-07-27T02:54:12+0000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Al Rabbani","id":"436443206686932"},"message":"Would using Java Webstart work, so you are basically asking the browser to start the application but not interact with them","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"1190007231038983"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEU0T1RjMU5Ua3hORE01TnpRME9Eb3hORFk1TlRVMU1qQXkZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEU1TURBd056SXpNVEF6T0RrNE16b3hORFk1TlRnNE1EVXkZD"}}}}
