Not an attack or to belittle you, but DDD is very hard to do right and requires a lot of guidance and reading the book even is not enough, it requires a whole supportive organization. My advice is to be pragmatic, if all you need is a CRUD Website, then do that. DDD is good for large enterprises with very knowledgeable domain experts, if your business domain is not that deep and the piece of software you are working on is not critical and does not differentiate you from competition AND again you do not have the guidance, then Anemic with proper abstraction is the way to go.  Also, if you don't see any bounded contexts or seams, either because you don't know what that is or you can't find them, please just do the normal CRUD with Business rules sandwiched between the data and UI layer.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"id":"1126389794067394"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5TmpJMU56QXpOelF4TkRBd016b3hORFl3T1RJMU1EWTAZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVEV5TmpNNE9UYzVOREEyTnpNNU5Eb3hORFl3T1RRek56STIZD"}}}}
