create  Mesh \"Cube\" i got empty scene\nAfter testing and debugging i knew it's about  protection level \nSetting the protection to Public and i got empty scene with no objects but variables are their and i can put values in them but i want to be dynamically \nIt works if i set protection to protected and set initial values but i want to edit them during run time and reading some data using XML file \nany idea why i'm getting this issue or anything i can do to solve this issue \nwould be
