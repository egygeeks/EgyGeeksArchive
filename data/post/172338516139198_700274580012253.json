Unless you have something to contribute to a thread, please don't derail one off topic. You're always free to start a thread of your own.\n\nEslam Hamouda  I haven't touched windows (or .net for that matter) in an awfully long time but thanks for the invitation to contribute :) Much appreciated.\n\nThat might give you some pointers http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd734783(v=ws.10).aspx#BKMK_3_add\n\nDo you manually type out the application's path or use something more generalized?\n\nAs for the approach, sending part of the image would prompt you to assemble the image on the client side which will end up being a hassle unless you use some creative approach (like maybe dividing your screen up into squares, as for the client side you'll end up with a canvas as your best approach)\n\nHave you considered sending a video stream? That might involve some DX or if windows has some device API I'm not aware of that can let you capture the monitor as a video stream.\nNow streaming that over to the client becomes a painless process and receiving that into a video tag on the client side is just about as easy as it gets.","can_remove":false,"like_count":1,"message_tags":[{"id":"1241719979282944","length":14,"name":"Mohamed Abdulbasit Elkady","offset":0,"type":"user"},{"id":"10210277573008432","length":13,"name":"Eslam Hamouda","offset":183,"type":"user"}],"user_likes":false,"id":"700388676667510"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekF3TWprM09EWXpNelF6TWpVNE9qRXpPVEl5TkRReE16VT0ZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZAOekF3TXpnNE5qYzJOalkzTlRFd09qRXpPVEl5TlRZAMk16VT0ZD"}}}}
