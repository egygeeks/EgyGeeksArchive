The DOD (traditionally largest backer and funder of CMMi) now is required to use agile practices in software projects..\n\nDOD issued the New Approach report that requires DOD to use agile practices in its acquisition of IT systems:\nhttp://www.afei.org/WorkingGroups/section804tf/Documents/OSD_Sec_804_Report.pdf\nThe SEI has issued a report analyzing DOD’s report:\nhttp://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/11sr015.pdf\n\nThe report recommends among other things:\n• A multi-level planning approach and a time boxed delivery manner. \n• New approaches should embrace the value of “80 percent solutions” (as appropriate).\n• Tangible evidence of relevant development capabilities in the form of prototypes or deployed systems (“working software”) will have preference in an evaluation with a commensurate decrease in paper-based proposal components.\n• Embrace the concept that incremental and iterative development and testing, including the use of prototyping, yield better outcomes than trying to deploy large, complex IT network systems in one big bang.\n• Requirements management process will be adjusted to reflect time boxed development constraints and allow for uncertainty. \n• Prioritization and further definition of requirements will be an ongoing activity.\n• Development efforts will focus on what can be achieved in the short term.\n• Development will involve continual test and evaluation with user involvement.\n• Test and evaluation will be structured to support iterative and incremental delivery. \n• Testing approaches will make extensive use of prototyping and automated testing.","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDfmH7Xa0GZ1w6S&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg1.blogblog.com%2Fimg%2Fwidgets%2Fsubscribe-yahoo.png","link":"http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2012/04/dod-goes-agile.html","name":"Scrum Log Jeff Sutherland: Update: DoD Goes Agile","caption":"scrum.jeffsutherland.com","description":"SCRUM LOG JEFF SUTHERLAND - Jeff created the first Scrum team in 1993 and worked with Ken Schwaber to formalize Scrum at OOPSLA'95.
