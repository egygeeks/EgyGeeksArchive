It's a tips & tricks post so it should offer idiomatic ruby code with proper styling and good solution design. I took the liberty and made this https://gist.github.com/l0gicpath/9163091\n\nThe notes I had about the code:\n\n- The simplest http server should still send header information\n\n- tabs should be 2 spaces (soft tabs) per indentation level\n\n- variables if started with a letter, the letter should be in a lower case\n\n- The server should hand off connections as fast as possible so move the dependency on an external process whose purpose is a shared interest into its own context\n\n- Spacing spacing spacing :D between operators +  - >=\n\n- Ruby probably has one of the largest collection of string literals, do. not. use. string concatenation for long strings\n\n- Stay consistent with double and single quotes, lines 19 to 23\n\nResult? Still a very small code base (50 SLOC) but in the true spirit of ruby :)","message_tags":[{"id":"1614120164","name":"Eslam Hamouda","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13},{"id":"627907956","name":"Emad Elsaid","type":"user","offset":363,"length":11}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-02-22T22:28:19+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"705137319525979","from":{"id":"627907956","name":"Emad Elsaid"},"message":"Nice, I will make sure apply these guides in my code :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-02-22T22:32:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"705317622841282","from":{"id":"661261340","name":"Mohammad Tayseer"},"message":"I'm wondering why don't you use HTTP server directly?
