However, her story has many holes. Why she's the only one who got punished? Why she didn't escalate the case - or even sue the company - it if it's illegal? Related to peer bonuses, you get them when you do something more than your assigned work goals, e.g. helping a colleague solve a bug. The sheet was nice, but it's not useful to the company.

Besides that, if Employees create a union like I've been asking for a long time, they would actually be able to shake down management into acting ethically. \"Business\" is not a synonym for \"Immorality\" :) , in a place where the rule of law is the case, the law should be fair and it should be applied. Every system will have a hole, in that case the management are obligated to take reasonable steps to accommodate, this is even done in public sector companies in Egypt btw :).
