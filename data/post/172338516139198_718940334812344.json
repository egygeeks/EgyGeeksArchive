I know mobinil, vodafone and etisalat are all crap and overpriced, but out of the 3 which one will be more usable in terms of speed and coverage? Also, do all 3 carriers block VoIP services such as skype?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/718940334812344"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/718940334812344"},{"name":"Report Post to Admin","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/members/"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-03-23T08:39:45+0000","updated_time":"2014-03-25T18:00:09+0000","is_hidden":false,"is_expired":false,"comments":{"data":[{"created_time":"2014-03-23T11:24:43+0000","from":{"name":"Hady Ahmed","id":"10210684524123349"},"message":"I don't know much about coverage and speed. However, with regards to blocking VoIP services, it's not the carriers people should point the blame at. It's the NTRA.\n\nEdit: And yes, they all do block it.

Yes i remember a few years back when Skype was mysteriously blocked on 3G. I also know that they all down-sample images horribly in order to reduce bandwidth. So it's just a matter of picking the one that sucks the least..\nDo they all offer the same connection frequencies?
