I know mobinil, vodafone and etisalat are all crap and overpriced, but out of the 3 which one will be more usable in terms of speed and coverage? Also, do all 3 carriers block VoIP services such as skype?","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/718940334812344"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/172338516139198/posts/718940334812344"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-03-23T08:39:45+0000","updated_time":"2014-03-25T18:00:09+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"718989928140718","from":{"id":"1055914266","name":"Hady Ahmad"},"message":"I don't know much about coverage and speed.

Yes i remember a few years back when Skype was mysteriously blocked on 3G. I also know that they all down-sample images horribly in order to reduce bandwidth.
