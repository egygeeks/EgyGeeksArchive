For the CLI the best practice would be:\n\nIf the library is TypeScript aware, it would have definitions in the same npm package. That's the best scenario, you just import it, don't even need to put it in angular-cli.json scripts.\n\nIf it doesn't have definitions built-in, look for them in npm under @types/library-name. Your imports might end up looking weird, like `import * as $ from \"jquery/dist/jquery\"` (I don't recommend using jQuery with Angular2, just an example), or if that doesn't work alone, you might need to add it to angular-cli.json scripts too.\n\nSometimes type definitions don't exist, or just are outdated. This becomes a question of practicality not best practice. You have 2 options: Either add a small-enough definition (`declare blah`) to get intellisense, or if the thing missing in definition is used in one place etc, you can just use `any` and go without intellisense.\n\nYou never add scripts manually to index.html in Angular CLI.","can_remove":false,"like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"id":"1376496135723424"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0zTmpRNU5qRXpOVGN5TXpReU5Eb3hORGcyTURVNU5EZA3cZD","after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANVE0zTmpRNU5qRXpOVGN5TXpReU5Eb3hORGcyTURVNU5EZA3cZD"}}}}
