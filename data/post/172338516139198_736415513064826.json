Something like significant white space in Python is considered a disadvantage, while most pythonistas consider it a good thing.\n\nOn the other hands, I believe it will be healthier if we compare programming languages as \"different\", not better or worse. They can work together, even if they are very similar like Ruby & Python. As an example, pygments is a popular syntax highlighter which has wrappers in many different languages, although it's written in Python.","can_remove":false,"like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"id":"737320956307615"},{"created_time":"2014-04-26T21:16:48+0000","from":{"name":"Alaa Attya Mohamed","id":"10210243495897310"},"message":"Amr Eldib yes i mean doing those debates as hangout.
